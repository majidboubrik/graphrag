Perks and benefits France.pdf,"Commute Benefits 2024 - France
Transport Passes 2024
In France, companies reimburse 50% of commuting costs to come to the office. See below the details to
get reimbursed, depending on the type and frequency of the pass you have:
‚óè Annual Paris Navigo/ImagineR - When you purchase/renew your Annual Navigo Pass,
send your annual contract to people@dataiku.com. The document must show your name,
dates of the contract and travel zones. You will need to send us this document only once a
year. Should the prices increase, Dataiku will automatically adjust your reimbursements. Be
careful! Renewals are not automatic: as soon as your annual contract ends, make you sure
you send us a copy of your new contract, otherwise reimbursements will stop.
‚óè Monthly & Weekly Paris Navigo/Other rail passes - If you have chosen a monthly or
weekly pass, you need to send every month your receipt to people@dataiku.com to get
reimbursed. The receipt can be a picture/scan of your RATP receipt or the digital receipt,
and show the period and travel zones. To get reimbursed the same month of your request,
make sure you send your receipt by the 17th of every month (payroll cut-off). Otherwise
your reimbursement will be processed the following month.
‚óè Note: Single tickets, Ticket+ Pack of 10 and Libert√©+ tickets are not eligible for company
reimbursement.
‚óè Reminder: Dataikers working with a fully remote contract are not eligible to company
transport reimbursement. If you travel to the Dataiku office, your transport expenses are
covered by the Travel & Expenses Policy.
Transport Passes from previous years
Only requests for 2024 receipts are now accepted. Dataiku won't process requests for past years receipts
anymore.
Sustainable Transport
If you are a sustainable commuter (carpool, electric or hybrid car, bike, electric scooter), you are eligible to
the Forfait Mobilit√© Durable and you can get a monthly allowance of 41,67 EUR (500 EUR per year). To get
reimbursed, please fill out and send a Declaration on Honor to people@dataiku.com. In this declaration
you will confirm that you are using the same commute method for the rest of the current calendar year.
Your request will be valid for the current calendar year. You will have to send us a new request in January
2025.
You can either benefit from the transport reimbursement OR Forfait de Mobilit√©
Durable.

Introduction
Dataiku provides private health insurance for UK-based Dataikers. This plan, managed by the insurer
Vitality, offers a wide range of healthcare expenses, including hospitalization, surgery, cancer treatment,
dental, vision, and more. This page details eligibility, coverage, exclusions, how to add beneficiaries, claim
expenses, and access care.
For Dataikers familiar with other countries' healthcare systems, please note that the UK operates on an
insurance system rather than a mutual fund (mutuelle). Here, you often need to seek prior authorization
before undergoing treatment or incurring health expenses.
Skip content
Eligibility
‚óè Full-time employees - including long-term, short-term contracts, interns & apprentices,
‚óè Part-time employees - working minimum 15 hours/ week,
‚óè Dependents - Children, spouses and civil partners.
All eligible employees must be UK residents for tax purposes and have in their possession a UK home
address. If you have just moved to the UK, a temporary address can work until you find a permanent one.
Contractors, freelancers, part-time employees below 15 hours per week are not eligible to the Vitality health
plan.

Enrollment & Cost
When you join Dataiku UK, you will be enrolled within the first 30 days of your arrival. You will receive an
e-mail to your personal address from Vitality confirming your enrollment, your membership number and a
link to the Vitality portal :
Log in and complete your profile (phone number, bank details‚Ä¶).
The cost is 100% covered by Dataiku for you and your children, and 50% for your partner (deducted via
payroll).
The costs of your premium depend on numerous factors, so if you wish to know how much you will be
paying for your partner, please reach out to People Ops at people@dataiku.com, we'll help you get a quote
with the breakdown of the price.

How to add beneficiaries?
‚óè When you join Dataiku, you will be enrolled by default. If your family situation changes, or if
you wish to enroll your family members, please contact People Ops (people@dataiku.com)
with : dependent name, first name, date of birth and relation. People Ops will get back to
you within the next 72 hours. Once enrollment is confirmed, you will receive the

App.
‚óè Newborn child: Contact people@dataiku.com as soon as the child is born, with the
following information: Name, First Name, Date of birth. People Ops will liaise with Vitality

How to remove beneficiaries?
To opt out of the Vitality health plan and remove your dependents, please contact People Ops at
people@dataiku.com and request the removal of the dependents from the plan. The effective date can‚Äôt
be backdated. The removal might take up to 48 hours. In order not to delay the cancellation process,
please ask your dependent not to use their coverage after you submitted the request. It might incur delay
and extra premium might be charged if the cancellation falls in a new membership month.
üí°To keep in mind! Be aware of the implications of opting out. Without private health insurance, you will
only rely on the NHS for healthcare. There may be longer wait times for certain treatments and procedures
compared to private healthcare.

How to access care
General Practitioners
To talk to a GP, you can either talk to your NHS GP, or use the Vitality GP services. On the Vitality portal, go
to CareHub / Vitality GP and select the type of appointment you want. Visiting other private GPs/private
clinics won‚Äôt be covered by Vitality but might be covered by the Personal Health Fund (their referral for
further treatments will likely be accepted though).
Treatments with referrals and pre-approvals required
For hospital, surgical procedures, out-patient, diagnostic, consultant fees, ambulance, cancer treatments‚Ä¶
you likely need to get a referral from a GP (see above) and a pre-approval from Vitality. To do so:
‚óè Login to vitality.co.uk/member,
‚óè Go to Member Zone and find the Health section,
‚óè Access CareHub,
‚óè Find Start a claim, describe your condition; you‚Äôll be able to choose from a medical
practitioner/hospital in the approved list of Vitality,
‚óè Alternatively, you can call Vitality directly (0345 602 3523).
Treatments without referral required
Physiotherapy - Access resources and personalized plans, book physiotherapy sessions from the Vitality
network directly without the need of a GP referral by clicking here.
Breast lump - If you notice a breast lump, Vitality offers immediate support without the need of a GP
referral . Arrange a call back and get more information by clicking here.
Mental health - In addition to Moka Care, Vitaly offers online resources, self-help therapies, as well as
talking therapies that don‚Äôt need prior referral from a GP. To access mental health care, click here.
Claimable expenses - For dental, optical and audiological care, you don‚Äôt need pre-approval. You will need
to find your own practitioner and pay for your treatments first, then get reimbursed (see limits in the
What‚Äôs covered section). To claim reimbursement, go to the ‚ÄôClaim back' section (click here).
Personal Health Fund Claims - For health expenses that are not covered by the main Vitality insurance,
you can use your money pot to get reimbursed (see limits in the Personal Health Fund section). To submit
your claim, click here.
Emergencies
In case of an emergency and if you need immediate support, here are your resources:
Vitality Health Advice Line - Members have access to a Health Advice Line which is a hotline with 24-hour
medical advice. Members can call if they are feeling unwell, need some medical advice, or unsure if they
should visit a GP : 0345 279 8856.
UK Accident & Emergency Services - For urgent medical attention ‚Äì for example chest pains, a suspected
stroke or a bone fracture ‚Äì call 999 or go straight to the nearest A&E.

Other FAQ
‚óè What happens if I go on unpaid leave? Your coverage will stop if you go on unpaid leave or
work less than 15 hours per week.
‚óè Is there any Underwriting ? No, Vitality covers you regardless of your medical history.
‚óè My partner also has health coverage through his/her company, can I also be covered by
his/her plan ? No, our Vitaliy terms and conditions specify that you cannot be under two
Corporate/Business health plans at the same time. However, you can subscribe to
additional private plans.
‚óè Can I opt out ? Yes, please contact people@dataiku.com.
‚óè Can you please clarify if the membership is subject to taxation? Private Medical Insurance
(PMI) is subject to Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) at a rate of 12% and any premium paid by
the employer constitutes a P11D benefit.
‚óè How will I receive the Vitality Cash Benefit? If you qualify to receive a cash benefit (i.e.
newborn child, NHS...), Vitality will wire directly the lump sum to you. Make sure your bank
details are updated on your Vitality portal.
‚óè How do I get a Certificate of Insurance? Generate a Certificate of Insurance on the Vitality
portal (in the My documents section, ‚ÄúYour health documents‚Äù). Some health providers
may request it.
Skip content
What happens when you leave Dataiku?
Dataiku offers Vitality health plan as an additional benefit, so in most cases your health plan will end when
you leave the company. The coverage is connected to your employment and once you are no longer an
employee of Dataiku LTD, the insurance policy is terminated.
If you still have ongoing treatments or you didn‚Äôt submit your claims, don‚Äôt forget to do it before your last
day, as Vitality won‚Äôt accept them after you leave.
There is also an option to maintain your existing coverage by converting your group policy into an
individual policy. You will be responsible for paying the monthly premium. If you wish to continue the
coverage, you can contact Vitality's continuation team for a quote at 0161 808 0573.
Skip content
Renewals
Our contract with Vitality runs from June to May every year. During the renewal period (Dataiku
renegociating the contract with the insurer), some features might be frozen/suspended (Vitality app,
online pre-approval...). Your coverage does continue. Call Vitality (0345 602 3523) if you need coverage
confirmations/treatment authorizations not available online.
Every year, you will receive a confirmation of renewal by e-mail, including potential changes of coverage
(and extra cost for dependents) and contribution structure. Updated policy will be communicated to you
at the same time. We usually hold a communication session with our broker every year in Spring between
May and June. The exact dates will be communicated closer to the event.

2. For specific events such as weddings, births, or funerals:
‚óè the law specifies that the days have to be requested not too long before/ after the event,
‚óè Please note: in some countries, we will ask you to provide an official document for our
records and statutory declarations.
3. The above information is provided as a summary overview. Additional terms and conditions may be

‚áí Request sick days on Workday immediately.
‚óè If you don't have a sick note and you were out, you need to take paid vacation time or

‚óè Note that you must take your sick leave from day 1 but you can return to work before the
end of it.
‚óè When the sick note is added into Workday, Dataiku will maintain your salary starting from
day 1.
For France Û∞èÉ:
You need a sick note from the doctor if you need to take paid sick days.
Request sick days in Workday within 48 hours of the first day of absence.
People Ops validates your sick leave request if one of the following document is attached
to the request:
Sick note (avis d‚Äôarr√™t de travail), page 5 (Volet 3) OR,
Hospital note in case of hospitalization (bulletin de situation)
If your doctor has not done so, send pages 3 (volet 1) and 4 (Volet 2) of your sick note to

Dear Dataikers,
In France, companies are obligated to ensure the health and safety of their employees. To fulfill this responsibility, we have
engaged the services of the company ACMS to conduct mandatory medical check-ups for all employees.
Whether you‚Äôre a new joiner or you‚Äôre due for your routine check-up (every 5 years), you‚Äôll receive a invitation from our medical
partner ACMS, on your Dataiku e-mail address.
These invitations are mandatory, so please make every effort to attend. Failure to attend without cancelling or postponing will
result in a ‚Ç¨75 fine, charged to your department. Furthermore, missing a medical check-up constitutes a violation of France labor
laws and may result in disciplinary action.
FAQ
What should I do if I cannot attend?
If you receive an invitation from ACMS but are unable to attend, you can either call ACMS at +33 1 43 46 50 50 or email them at
acms-gare-de-lyon@acms.asso.fr to reschedule your appointment (They speak French and English). Please do so at least 48 hours
before the scheduled appointment.
I am a fully remote Dataiker and cannot attend the proposed slot, what should I do?
Try to plan a business trip around the invitation date, or postpone your appointment by contacting the ACMS to re-arrange it when
you come visit the Paris office.
I joined Dataiku recently and haven‚Äôt received an invitation yet.
Due to a shortage of company doctors in France, available slots are extremely limited. You will be contacted by ACMS as soon as
slots free up.
I need to speak with the company doctor, should I wait for the routine check-up?
Outside of the routine check-ups, you can request to meet with the company doctor at any time. Feel free to contact ACMS directly
using the contact details provided above.
Are there any items I should bring with me to my medical check-up?
Please bring a valid ID and, if applicable, your glasses or contact lenses, and any medical information you would like to bring to the
attention of the company doctor.
Will the information discussed with the company doctor be shared with Dataiku?
No, anything discussed during your medical check-up is strictly confidential, protected by medical secrecy, and won‚Äôt be shared
with Dataiku. The company doctor will only issue a memo confirming you are fit for work (or if a job accommodation is required)
that will be sent to the People Ops team.

health plan covers medical, hospitalization, dental, vision, and maternity benefits, both in the UAE and overseas.
Introduction
Full-Time and Part-Time Employees
Dependents based in the UAE:
Spouse or partner (living together in a conjugal relationship for a continuous period of 12 months) with a valid UAE
visa.
Children until they are 17 years old, or until they are 25 if in full-time education.
Dependents not based in the UAE:
They can be added as Non-UAE Residents if they meet the criteria above. Please check with People@dataiku.com for
conditions offered by Allianz for dependents outside the UAE.
Who is eligible¬†
When you join the company, Dataiku will automatically share your information from Workday with Allianz. Ensure your Workday
profile is up-to-date with the following details: address, Emirates ID, passport number, personal email address, number of
dependents, and marital status.
Once enrolled, Allianz will send you a welcome email containing your digital health card, the employee benefits guide, and your

date).
Dataiku covers 100% of the premiums for you and your dependents.
Enrollment & Cost
Newborns
To ensure your newborn is enrolled quickly and all health expenses are covered from birth, send the birth certificate to
people@dataiku.com within 7 calendar days. If received after this period, coverage will start upon registration in Allianz's system.
Within 120 days after birth, Allianz will need the Emirates ID, passport, and visa for the newborn. Allianz will accept the baby
without medical underwriting if the birth parent or intended parent (in the case of surrogacy) has been insured with us for a
minimum of eight continuous months.

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTORY POLICIES
A. INTRODUCTION
This United States Employee Handbook (the ‚ÄúHandbook‚Äù) is designed to familiarize you with the
policies, practices, and benefits of Dataiku Inc. (‚ÄúDataiku‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) specific to
employees in the United States. Please read it together with other Dataiku global policies, practices,
and procedures (‚ÄúDataiku Global Policies‚Äù). If there are any inconsistencies between any Dataiku
Global Policies and this Handbook, the policies, practices, and benefits set out in this Handbook
prevail.
Although the Handbook is not a contract and is not intended to create any express or implied
contractual obligations, all United States employees are required to read and understand the
provisions of the Handbook. Circumstances will undoubtedly require that the policies, practices,
and benefits described in the Handbook change from time to time. Accordingly, except for the
at-will employment policy, Dataiku reserves the right to revise, modify, rescind, delete, or add to
the provisions of this Handbook at any time without notice in its sole and absolute discretion, as
permitted by applicable law. No oral statements or representations can, in any way, change or alter
the provisions of this Handbook.
As copies of this Handbook will only be re-distributed periodically, the most current version will
always be available on the Dataiku Galaxy.
B. AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT
Employment at Dataiku is employment at-will. Employment at-will may be terminated with or
without cause, for any reason or for no reason, with or without notice, at any time by an employee
or Dataiku. Nothing in this Handbook or in any document or statement limits the right to terminate
employment at-will. With the exception of the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Executive
Officer‚Äôs designee, who can only do so in writing, no employees of Dataiku have any authority to
enter into any agreement for employment for a specified period of time or to make any agreement
or representation contrary to Dataiku‚Äôs policy of employment at-will.
C. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY1
Dataiku is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions on the basis of merit
and business needs. Dataiku does not unlawfully discriminate against, nor does it tolerate unlawful
harassment by, any person, including, but not limited to, non-managerial and managerial
employees and third parties, on the basis of race, color, religion or creed, alienage or citizenship
status, political affiliation, marital or partnership status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or
mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth
(or related medical conditions), sex, sexual orientation, sexual and other reproductive health
1 This policy, like all policies in this Handbook, can be modified unilaterally by Dataiku at any time without notice.
Modification may be necessary to maintain compliance with local, state, and federal laws or to accommodate
organizational changes within Dataiku.

decisions, genetic disorder, genetic predisposition, carrier status, military status, familial status,
domestic violence victim status, or any other basis protected under federal, state, or local laws.
In addition, Dataiku complies with all applicable laws regarding job applicants or employees‚Äô
criminal convictions, arrest record, prior criminal accusations, salary history, credit history,
unemployment status, political activities, and recreational activities.
D. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
Dataiku does not tolerate discrimination in employment against otherwise qualified applicants and
employees because of a physical or mental disability, nor does Dataiku tolerate discrimination
based on a perception of, or association with, persons with such a disability. In addition, Dataiku
will provide reasonable accommodation to individuals with a physical or mental disability, if the
accommodation would enable the individual to apply for, or satisfactorily perform the essential
functions of, the position in question and would not impose an undue hardship on Dataiku. A
reasonable accommodation might be an adjustment to the work environment or an adjustment to
the manner or circumstances under which the essential functions of the job are performed, as
determined on a case-by-case basis. All employees are required to perform the essential functions
of their jobs.
It is the responsibility of any employee who has a physical or mental condition that limits the
individual in performing the essential functions of his/her position in question to make his/her need
for reasonable accommodation known to Dataiku by contacting their manager or People Business
Partner. Any manager who learns that an employee may have such a condition and may need
accommodation to meet the requirements of his/her job should also contact their People Business
Partner, who will help determine what accommodations may be reasonable and effective.
Upon receiving a request for an accommodation, Dataiku will engage with the employee in what is
known as the ‚Äúinteractive process and cooperative dialogue.‚Äù The purpose of the interactive
process and cooperative dialogue is to understand the needs of the employee and, based on the
circumstances, to identify any potential reasonable accommodations. In accordance with applicable
law, Dataiku may require that the employee provide medical documentation confirming that the
employee has a disability and needs reasonable accommodation. Information and documentation
regarding an employee‚Äôs disability shall be kept confidential in accordance with applicable law.
Upon reaching a final determination at the conclusion of the interactive process and cooperative
dialogue, Dataiku will provide the requesting employee with a final determination in writing,
identifying each accommodation granted or denied.
New York City employees may refer to the Pregnancy Accommodations at Work notice attached as
Attachment 2 to this Handbook pursuant to the New York City Human Rights Law.
E. LACTATION ACCOMMODATION
In accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, Dataiku will provide all employees
desiring to express breast milk at work with reasonable accommodations, including a reasonable
amount of break time. The break time will be required to run concurrently, if possible, with any
paid break time already provided. In the event it is not possible for the break time for expressing
2
milk to run concurrently with the paid break time already provided to the employee, the break time
for expressing milk is unpaid.
Dataiku‚Äôs New York City Office currently includes a dedicated lactation room. To the extent that
room is unavailable, employees in Dataiku‚Äôs New York City Office may request a lactation room
by submitting a written request to their manager or HR (at HR-Amer@dataiku.com). Dataiku will
respond within five (5) business days of receiving the written request. In the event that two (2) or
more individuals require the use of a lactation room at the same time, the individuals should
contact HR (at HR-Amer@dataiku.com), who will work with the involved parties to find an
amicable solution.
Employees in Dataiku‚Äôs New York City Office will be provided with use of a room or other
location, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the employee‚Äôs work area. The employee‚Äôs
normal work area may be used if it allows the employee to express milk in private. If the room
designated by Dataiku to serve as a lactation room is also used for another purpose, the sole
function of the room shall be as a lactation room while an employee is using the room to express
breast milk. Dataiku will also provide all employees desiring to express breast milk at work with a
refrigerator suitable for breast milk storage. Employees storing breast milk in a work refrigerator
should clearly label any containers so Dataiku does not discard the container in the normal course
of business. If a request for a lactation room poses an undue hardship on Dataiku, Dataiku will
engage in a cooperative dialogue with the employee.
Employees who work from Dataiku WeWork (or other temporary workspace) locations that do not
currently have dedicated lactation rooms may contact their manager or HR to discuss potential
options.
F. POLICIES PROHIBITING HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND
RETALIATION
Global Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy
Dataiku‚Äôs global Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy (the ‚ÄúGlobal Harassment
Policy‚Äù), which is applicable to all Dataiku employees, is available on the Dataiku Galaxy. In
addition to the Global Harassment Policy, the policies contained in this section regarding
harassment also apply to all US employees. In the event of a conflict between the Global
Harassment Policy and the policies contained in this Handbook regarding harassment, the policies
contained in this Handbook will control.
Harassment and Sexual Harassment
Harassment, including sexual harassment, is a form of prohibited employee misconduct and may
take many forms. The most common forms include: verbal harassment (e.g., jokes, epithets, slurs,
negative stereotyping, or unwelcome remarks about an individual‚Äôs body, physical characteristics,
appearance, or sexual practices, or gossiping about any matters that may rise to the level of
harassment or sexual harassment); physical harassment (e.g., physical interference with normal
work, impeding or blocking movement, assault, unwelcome physical contact, or leering at a
person‚Äôs body); and visual harassment (e.g., offensive or obscene pictures or emails, gestures,
display of sexually suggestive or lewd objects, unwelcome notes or letters, or any other written or
3
graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual that is placed or
circulated in the workplace).
Harassment may be sexual in nature. Sexual harassment includes harassment of women by men, of
men by women, same-sex harassment, and harassment by/toward anyone who does not identify as
a man or woman. Sexual harassment is unlawful whether it involves co-worker harassment,
harassment by a supervisor or manager, or by persons doing business with or for Dataiku. There are
two distinct categories of sexual harassment: (1) quid pro quo (when an individual‚Äôs submission to,
or rejection of, unwelcome sexual conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting
that individual, including granting of employment benefits); and (2) hostile environment (when
unwelcome sexual conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual‚Äôs job performance or creates
an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, even if it does not lead to tangible or
economic job consequences). Sexually harassing conduct does not need to be motivated by sexual
desire to be considered unlawful.
Individuals and Conduct Covered
These policies apply to all applicants and Dataikers, whether related to conduct engaged in by
fellow Dataikers or by someone not directly connected to Dataiku (e.g., an outside vendor,
consultant, or customer). Similarly, these policies apply to conduct directed toward all applicants,
Dataikers, non-employee independent contractors, and temporary employees.
Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related
setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings, and
business-related social events.
Reporting and Investigation
If employees believe they have been subjected to, or have witnessed, harassment or discrimination
of any kind or any conduct that violates this policy, they should bring the matter to the Company‚Äôs
attention promptly so that any concern of harassment or discrimination can be investigated and
addressed appropriately.
There are three channels to report such behavior:
1. Immediately report the facts of the matter to your supervisor or department head;
2. Immediately report the facts of the matter to your People Business Partner; and/or
3. Make an anonymous report on Dataiku‚Äôs EthicsPoint platform, as outlined below.
Dataiku has engaged Navex Global to provide EthicsPoint, its comprehensive and confidential
reporting tool, to provide an anonymous hotline for all Dataikers. The purpose of the service is to
ensure that any Dataiker wishing to submit a report anonymously can do so without the fear of
retribution.
EthicsPoint‚Äôs online reporting tool is available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week
for use by Dataikers at: https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/78396/index.html.
4
Reports sent to EthicsPoint can be submitted anonymously, but make sure you write down and
secure the report key ID after submitting any report. The report key ID is the only mechanism
that will allow you to track the progress of the report anonymously - if you lose that key, you will
no longer be able to track the investigation process.
All reports submitted to EthicsPoint will be assigned and reviewed in detail. Please refer to the
Incident Management Reporting and Management Process (available on Dataiku Galaxy) for
further details regarding the investigation process. At the conclusion of any investigation, if the
Company determines that a violation of a policy, standard or operating procedure has occurred, the
Company will take appropriate measures commensurate with the severity of the issue, including
sanctions in accordance with Dataiku‚Äôs Human Resource Progressive Discipline Policy (available
on Dataiku Galaxy).
Additional Enforcement Information
In addition to Dataiku‚Äôs internal complaint procedure set out in this Handbook and in the Dataiku
Non-discrimination and Anti-harassment policy, employees should also be aware that the federal
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‚ÄúEEOC‚Äù), the New York Division of Human Rights
(‚ÄúNYSDHR‚Äù), and the New York City Commission on Human Rights (‚ÄúNYCCHR‚Äù) investigate
and prosecute complaints of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation in employment. These
agencies enforce protections granted under applicable federal, state, and local law, which may avail
employees of remedies for violations thereof, including back pay, front pay, damages, and other
equitable remedies. Each agency has a statute of limitations by which complaints must be filed and
there is no cost to file. Note that complaining internally to Dataiku does not extend your time to file
with the agency. Employees may contact these agencies, as well as other applicable state agencies,
directly. Their phone numbers and contact information can be found online. For ease of reference,
and in accordance with applicable local law, information regarding the following agencies is
provided. Information about the EEOC complaint procedure can be found on its website:
www.eeoc.gov. Employees may also contact the EEOC at: 1-800-669-4000 (English) or
1-800-669-6820 (TTY). Information about the NYSDHR can be found on its website:
www.dhr.ny.gov/. Employees may also contact the NYSDHR at: 1-888-392-3644. Information
about the NYCCHR can be found on its website: http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr. Employees may
contact the NYCCHR at: 212-504-4115. New York City employees may also refer to the Stop
Sexual Harassment Act Factsheet attached as Attachment 4 to this Handbook.
Retaliation
Retaliation by any person, including, but not limited to, co-workers, managers, and third parties,
for reporting any incidents of harassment or discrimination, or perceived harassment or
discrimination, for making any complaints of harassment or discrimination, or participating in any
investigation of incidents of harassment or discrimination, or perceived harassment or
discrimination, is strictly prohibited. Any report of retaliation by one accused of harassment or
discrimination, or by co-workers, supervisors, or managers, will also be promptly and thoroughly
investigated. If a complaint of retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to, and
including, termination of employment, will be taken.
5
G. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DECISION-MAKING
Dataiku does not discriminate or retaliate against employees based on an employee‚Äôs or an
employee‚Äôs dependent‚Äôs reproductive health care decisions, including the decisions to use or access
a particular drug, device, or medical service. All employees in New York are entitled to the rights
and remedies set forth in New York Labor Law Section 203-e.
H. IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE
All offers of employment by Dataiku are contingent on verification of an employee‚Äôs right to work
in the U.S. Prior to an employee‚Äôs first day of work, the employee will be asked to provide original
documents verifying the employee‚Äôs right to work and to sign a verification form required by
federal law. If an employee, at any time, cannot verify the employee‚Äôs right to work in the U.S.,
Dataiku may be obligated to terminate the employee‚Äôs employment.
I. PROTECTED ACTIVITY NOT PROHIBITED
Nothing in this Handbook limits or prohibits employees from engaging for a lawful purpose in any
‚ÄúProtected Activity.‚Äù ‚ÄúProtected Activity‚Äù means filing a charge or complaint with, or otherwise
communicating, cooperating, or participating with, any state, federal, or other governmental
agency, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the EEOC, and the National Labor
Relations Board. Notwithstanding any other policies in this Handbook (or elsewhere), employees
are not required to obtain authorization from Dataiku prior to disclosing information to, or
communicating with, such agencies, nor are employees obligated to advise Dataiku on any such
disclosures or communications. Notwithstanding, in making any such disclosures or
communications, employees must take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use
or disclosure of any information that may constitute Dataiku confidential information to any parties
other than the relevant government agencies. ‚ÄúProtected Activity‚Äù does not include the disclosure
of any Dataiku attorney-client privileged communications; any such disclosure, without Dataiku‚Äôs
written consent, violates Dataiku policy. Employees may keep a copy of this Handbook after
termination of employment. In addition, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, all
employees are notified that an individual will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any
federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made in confidence to
a federal, state, or local government official (directly or indirectly) or to an attorney solely for the
purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (ii) is made in a complaint or
other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if (and only if) such filing is made under seal.
In addition, an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the individual‚Äôs attorney and use the
trade secret information in the court proceeding if the individual files any document containing the
trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
Chapter 2. EMPLOYMENT STATUS, WORK HOURS, AND WAGES
A. EMPLOYMENT STATUS
The eligibility for all Dataikers to participate in any employee benefit plans and programs are
subject to the eligibility requirements, enrollment criteria, and the other terms and conditions of
such plans and programs. Regular full-time employees generally qualify for all such benefits.
6
Regular part-time employees generally qualify for only certain benefits. Employees hired on a
fixed-term basis (‚ÄúTerm Employees‚Äù) generally only qualify for all such benefits if they are
typically scheduled to work thirty (30) hours or more in a week. Unless otherwise determined by
Dataiku, or as required by applicable law, interns and Term Employees scheduled to work less than
thirty (30) hours in a week are not eligible for benefits. In addition, because all employees are
at-will, these classifications do not guarantee employment or the provision of benefits for any
definite period of time. Dataikers who are unsure of their employment status should contact their
People Business Partner.
B. EXEMPT AND NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES
Exempt employees are all employees who are classified as exempt from the overtime provisions of
applicable wage and hour laws. Non-exempt employees are all employees who are covered by the
overtime provisions of applicable wage and hour laws.
C. MEAL BREAKS
A non-exempt employee who works more than six (6) hours in their workday, which extends over
the noon meal period (11 a.m. to 2 p.m.), is entitled to at least a thirty (30) minute meal period to be
taken between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. If a non-exempt employee starts his or her workday before 11
a.m. and continues after 7 p.m., the non-exempt employee is entitled to at least the thirty (30)
minute noon meal period and an additional twenty (20) minute break between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. A
non-exempt employee who works more than six (6) hours in their workday, and who starts between
the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., is entitled to a meal period of at least forty five (45) minutes
in the middle of his or her workday.
D. TIMEKEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES
All non-exempt employees are required to record their time on a weekly basis on the time card
form provided by Dataiku, and to submit their time card form to their manager every Monday. All
time records are approved by the employee‚Äôs manager before payday and are submitted to HR for
processing. It is important for employees to keep accurate time records and to turn them in when
they are due. A time card is a legal document and must not be tampered with. Corrections must be
approved by the employee‚Äôs manager and Dataiku‚Äôs payroll manager. Clocking in or out for a
fellow employee or falsifying one‚Äôs own or another employee‚Äôs time records is dishonest and may
lead to immediate termination of employment.
E. OVERTIME
As necessary, employees may be required to work overtime; only non-exempt employees, however,
qualify for overtime pay. To work overtime, a non-exempt employee must obtain written
permission from his or her supervisor. If a non-exempt employee works overtime without
permission, the employee may be disciplined, up to and including discharge. Dataiku provides
compensation for all overtime hours worked by non-exempt employees in accordance with
applicable law.
7
F. PAYMENT OF WAGES
Employees of Dataiku are paid on a semi-monthly basis, on the 15th and last day of the month for
work performed up to that day. If a regular payday falls on a holiday or a weekend, employees will
be paid on the preceding workday. Dataiku does not permit advances against paychecks, nor does it
allow employees to use paid time off, if any, in lieu of notice upon termination of employment.
G. PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
The law requires that Dataiku withhold taxes from employees‚Äô wages. These are: (1) Federal
income tax; (2) state income tax; (3) Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) (Social Security
and Medicare); (4) New York State Disability Insurance (SDI); and (4) any deductions required
under applicable city law. Dataiku will take other deductions from wages as required by law.
Employees who want to change the number of exemptions or marital status for federal or state
income tax withholding purposes should revise their applicable tax information directly in
Workday.
H. SALARY PAY FOR EXEMPT EMPLOYEES
Subject to any exceptions provided by law, salaried exempt employees will receive their salary for
any week in which they perform any work. Employees are encouraged to bring any questions
concerning their salary pay to their People Business Partner so that any inadvertent error can be
corrected. It is Dataiku‚Äôs policy to comply with the salary basis requirements of the Fair Labor
Standards Act and applicable state law. Therefore, Dataiku prohibits improper deductions from the
salaries of exempt employees. If employees are exempt employees and believe that an improper
deduction has been made to their salary, employees should immediately report this information to
their direct supervisor or to their People Business Partner. Reports of improper deductions will be
promptly investigated. If it is determined that an improper deduction has occurred, employees will
be promptly reimbursed.
Chapter 3. EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AND CONDUCT
A. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
Employees will receive periodic performance reviews, which Dataiku typically conducts twice a
year. Performance evaluations may review factors such as the quality and quantity of work,
knowledge of the job, initiative, work attitude, and attitude toward others. Performance evaluations
should help employees become aware of their progress and areas for improvement. A good
performance evaluation does not guarantee any increase in compensation and increases in
compensation are entirely at Dataiku‚Äôs discretion and may not occur every year. A good
performance review or a compensation increase is not a promise of continued employment. Rather,
employment at Dataiku is at-will and may be terminated by the employee or Dataiku at any time
for any reason or no reason, with or without notice.
B. WORKPLACE VIOLENCE
Dataiku has zero tolerance for acts and threats of violence. All such acts and threats, even those
made in apparent jest, will be taken seriously and will lead to appropriate discipline, which may
8
include termination of employment. A threat includes, but is not limited to, any indication of intent
to harm a person or his/her property, or damage Dataiku property. Threats may be direct or indirect,
and they may be communicated verbally or nonverbally. It is every employee‚Äôs responsibility to
assist in establishing and maintaining a violence-free work environment. Employees are expected
to report to a supervisor or manager all actual or perceived threatening or violent incidents. Dataiku
is committed to thoroughly investigating all reports of workplace violence and will take immediate,
appropriate action commensurate with the offense. Depending on the circumstance, Dataiku may
choose to place an individual on leave (paid or unpaid at Dataiku‚Äôs discretion) while it investigates
a complaint. Anyone with questions about the application of this policy should contact HR.
C. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
While employed by Dataiku, employees are expected to devote their energies to their jobs with
Dataiku. For this reason, second jobs are strongly discouraged. The following types of outside
employment are strictly prohibited: employment that conflicts with an employee‚Äôs work schedule,
duties, or responsibilities; employment that creates a conflict of interest or is incompatible with an
employee‚Äôs employment with Dataiku; employment that interferes with the protection of Dataiku‚Äôs
proprietary or confidential information; employment that impairs or has a detrimental effect on an
employee‚Äôs work performance; employment that requires an employee to conduct work or related
activities for outside employment on or using Dataiku‚Äôs property (i.e., facilities or equipment) or
during an employee‚Äôs working hours; and employment that directly or indirectly competes with the
business or the interests of Dataiku. Employees who wish to engage in outside employment that
may implicate any of the foregoing items must submit a written request to Dataiku explaining the
details of the outside employment. If the outside employment is authorized, Dataiku assumes no
responsibility for the outside employment. Dataiku does not provide workers‚Äô compensation
coverage or any other benefit for injuries occurring from, or arising out of, outside employment.
Dataiku can revoke authorization to engage in outside employment at any time.
D. SUBSTANCE ABUSE
Dataiku is focused on providing safe and healthy working conditions for all Dataikers and,
accordingly, is committed to (i) ensuring a workplace free from illegal drugs and controlled
substances and (ii) assisting in the rehabilitation of any Dataiker who voluntarily requests
assistance. While alcohol is permitted in our offices, all Dataikers should use proper judgment
when consuming alcohol, and this policy should be read to apply to circumstances where
consuming alcohol impairs work performance or results in other inappropriate behavior that can
endanger themselves or others (including Dataikers and third parties), or that violates applicable
laws or other Dataiku policies.
Dataiku expressly prohibits the following activities at any time that employees are either (1) on
duty or conducting Dataiku business (either on or away from a Dataiku office), or (2) at a Dataiku
office (whether or not the employee is working):
‚óè The use, abuse, or being under the influence of illegal drugs, or other impairing substances.
‚óè The possession, sale, purchase, transfer, or transit of any illegal or unauthorized drug,
including prescription medication that is not prescribed to the employee or drug-related
paraphernalia.
9
‚óè The abuse of alcohol such that work performance is impaired or the employee engages in
inappropriate behavior that can endanger themselves or others (including Dataikers and
third parties), or that violates applicable laws.
‚óè The illegal use or abuse of prescription drugs.2
Violation of the above rules and standards of conduct may result in disciplinary action, up to, and
including, termination of employment. Dataiku may also bring the matter to the attention of
appropriate law enforcement authorities.
In order to enforce this policy, as well as other Dataiku policies, Dataiku reserves the right to
conduct searches of Dataiku property, employees, or their personal property, including, but not
limited to, lockers, packages, purses, backpacks, and other personal property brought onto Dataiku
premises. Dataiku also reserves the right to implement other measures necessary to deter and detect
abuse of this policy. A request to search is not indicative of individualized suspicion. Dataiku
encourages and will reasonably accommodate employees with drug or alcohol dependencies to
seek treatment or rehabilitation. To this end, employees desiring such assistance should request a
treatment or rehabilitation leave. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dataiku is not obligated to
continue to employ any person whose performance of essential job duties is impaired because of
drug or alcohol use, nor is Dataiku obligated to re-employ any person who has participated in
treatment or rehabilitation if that person‚Äôs job performance remains impaired as a result of
dependency. Additionally, employees who are given the opportunity to seek treatment or
rehabilitation, but who fail to successfully overcome their dependency or problem, will not
automatically be given a second opportunity to seek treatment or rehabilitation. This policy on
treatment and rehabilitation is not intended to affect Dataiku‚Äôs treatment of employees who violate
the regulations described above. Rather, rehabilitation is an option for employees who
acknowledge a drug or alcohol dependency and voluntarily seek treatment to end that dependency.
Employees with a drug or alcohol dependency who are not seeking treatment are not qualified as a
disabled individual under applicable law.
E. PUNCTUALITY AND ATTENDANCE
Employees are expected to report to work on time and be prepared to start work. If employees are
unable to report to work on any particular day, employees must promptly speak with their
supervisor as soon as possible before the time they are scheduled to begin working for that day. If
employees know, in advance, that they are going to be absent, employees must schedule the
absence with their supervisor as soon as possible in advance of such absence (which generally
should be at least one week in advance). Employees are also required to contact their supervisor for
each additional day of absence unless they have submitted a note from a physician certifying their
illness or other similar issue or have otherwise been relieved of this obligation by their supervisor.
Excessive absences, abuse of Dataiku‚Äôs leave policies, failure to report absences on time, and
excessive tardiness may lead to discipline, up to, and including, termination of employment.
2 Nothing in this policy is meant to prohibit the appropriate use of over-the-counter medication or other medication that can legally
be prescribed under both federal and state law, to the extent that it does not impair an employee's job performance or safety or the
safety of others. Employees who take such medication should inform their People Business Partner if they believe the medication
will impair their job performance, safety, or the safety of others or if they believe they need a reasonable accommodation before
reporting to work while under the influence of that medication. For more information on how to request a reasonable
accommodation, please refer to Dataiku‚Äôs Reasonable Accommodations Policy above.
10
F. CONFIDENTIALITY
As a condition of employment, each employee must execute a Non-Disclosure and Invention
Assignment Agreement prior to beginning employment with Dataiku. Employees are responsible
for safeguarding confidential information obtained in connection with their employment. In the
course of their work, employees may have access to confidential information regarding Dataiku, its
suppliers, its customers, employees, or other third parties. Employees must not (i) use any such
information unless it is necessary for them to do so in the performance of their employment duties
and (ii) reveal or divulge any such information except to persons authorized by Dataiku to receive
this information. Access to confidential information should be on a ‚Äúneed-to-know‚Äù basis and must
be authorized by employees‚Äô supervisors or the Legal Team. An employee‚Äôs obligation to maintain
the confidentiality of this information continues after termination of employment. Any breach of
this policy will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary or legal action against the breaching
employee.
G. BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Dataiku values its reputation for honesty, integrity, and high ethical standards and all employees are
required to adhere to Dataiku‚Äôs Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedures, available on the Dataiku
Galaxy.
H. TELEPHONE AND DEVICE POLICY
Employees are required to comply with all laws regarding the use of phones while driving,
including laws prohibiting text messaging while driving. Under no circumstances are employees
required to answer the phone to conduct Company business while driving. Whenever possible,
employees should not make or receive calls while driving. If employees do make calls while
driving, they must use a hands-free device. Employees may not send work-related emails or text
messages while driving. Under no circumstances should employees use wireless phones during
adverse weather or difficult traffic conditions. Employees who violate this policy will be
considered to be operating outside the course and scope of their employment. Any violations of this
policy will subject employees to disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination of
employment.
I. OTHER PROHIBITED CONDUCT
The following conduct is also prohibited and will not be tolerated by Dataiku: (1) unlawful
harassment, including sexual harassment; (2) stealing or removing, without permission, Dataiku
property or property of another employee, a customer, or a visitor; (3) violating any Dataiku safety
or security rule, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules; (4) falsifying
employment records, employment information, or other Dataiku records; (5) unauthorized use of
Dataiku equipment, time, materials, or facilities; (6) deliberate destruction or damage to any
Dataiku property or the property of any employee, customer, or visitor; (7) insubordination,
including, but not limited to, failure or refusal to obey the instructions of a supervisor or the use of
abusive or threatening language toward a supervisor; (8) failing to promptly report to a supervisor
the loss of, or known malfunctioning of, tools or equipment, electrical or mechanical; (9) working
unauthorized overtime or refusing to work; (10) with respect to non-exempt employees, failure to
take meal and rest breaks; and (11) bringing weapons of any kind into a Dataiku workplace. The
11
list merely contains examples of conduct that may lead to disciplinary action. It does not constitute
a complete list of all types of conduct that can result in disciplinary action. This list of prohibited
conduct does not alter the at-will nature of all employees‚Äô employment.
J. VOLUNTARY TERMINATION
Employees who voluntarily resign from their employment or excessively fail to report to work
during scheduled workdays without notice to, or approval by, their manager, will be considered to
have voluntarily terminated employment with Dataiku. All Dataiku property must be returned
immediately upon termination of employment.
Chapter 4. EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
A. PERSONNEL RECORDS
To ensure that Dataiku‚Äôs files are kept up to date, employees should update their Workday, Sequoia,
Fidelity and other related profiles to account for any personal changes impacting their employment
or benefits (such as changes in address, phone number, marital status, or number of dependents).
Although Dataiku takes reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of personal identifiable
information (such as the addresses and telephone numbers of current and former employees),
Dataiku at times may be required to produce such personal identifiable information to third parties
pursuant to, and in accordance with, directions from legal authorities.
B. NEW YORK EMPLOYEE INFORMATION
In accordance with New York law, Dataiku will not, unless required by other applicable law:
publicly post or display an employee‚Äôs Social Security number; visibly print a Social Security
number on any identification badge or card (including time cards); place a Social Security number
in files or documents with unrestricted access; communicate an employee‚Äôs personal identifying
information (including an employee‚Äôs Social Security number, home address/telephone number,
personal e-mail address, Internet name/password, parent's surname prior to marriage, or drivers'
license number) to the general public; or permit any unlawful disclosures of an employee‚Äôs Social
Security number.
Chapter 5. OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
A. EMPLOYER PROPERTY
All Dataiku property must be maintained according to Dataiku rules and regulations. Dataiku
reserves the right to inspect all Dataiku property to ensure compliance with its rules and
regulations, without notice to employees or in employees‚Äô absence. Prior authorization must be
obtained before any Dataiku property may be removed from the premises. Personal property of
employees, including, but not limited to, lockers, packages, purses, backpacks, and any other
personal items brought onto Dataiku premises, is subject to inspection, at the discretion of Dataiku.
12
B. TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
Dataiku provides an e-mail system, access to the Internet, and other technology systems to assist
employees in conducting Dataiku business. All information, data, and messages created, received,
sent, or stored in these systems are, at all times, the property of Dataiku. All existing Dataiku
policies, including, but not limited to, Dataiku policies regarding information security, intellectual
property, misuse of Dataiku property, discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, information
and data security, social media, and confidentiality, apply to the conduct of employees on the
Internet and when using technology systems. Dataiku does not allow its systems to be used to
create, receive, send, or store data that may reasonably be considered to be defamatory, obscene,
discriminating, or harassing. Such data includes, but is not limited to, sexual images and comments,
racial and gender-based slurs, or anything that would reasonably be expected to offend someone
based on a legally-protected class. Any such use would violate this policy and may violate
Dataiku‚Äôs policy against harassment and could potentially subject the employee to Dataiku‚Äôs HR
Progressive Discipline Policy on the Dataiku Galaxy. In particular, the display of any kind of
sexually explicit image or document on any Dataiku system is a violation of the Dataiku‚Äôs policy
against sexual harassment. Employees who are aware of the misuse of these systems by other
employees should report the misuse to a manager or their People Business Partner immediately.
All employees should be aware that Dataiku has software and systems in place that are capable of
monitoring and recording all network traffic to and from any Dataiku asset employees may use.
Dataiku reserves the right to access, review, copy, and delete any of the information, data, or
messages accessed through these systems with or without notice to employees or in employees‚Äô
absence. This includes, but is not limited to, all e-mail messages sent or received, all website visits,
all chat sessions, all news group activity (including groups visited, messages read, and employee
postings), and all file transfers into and out of Dataiku‚Äôs internal networks. Dataiku further reserves
the right to retrieve previously deleted messages from Dataiku company e-mail and monitor usage
of the Internet, including websites visited and any information employees have downloaded. In
addition, Dataiku may review Internet and technology systems activity and analyze usage patterns,
and may choose to publicize this data. Employees should have no expectation of privacy as to
their Internet or technology systems usage and should not use these systems for information they
wish to keep private. Dataiku reserves the right to inspect any and all files stored in all areas of
Dataiku‚Äôs network, including those assigned to individual employees, and those stored on any
Dataiku computer, in order to assure compliance with this and other Dataiku policies.
For further information on Dataiku‚Äôs policies and regulations relating to company technology
systems, please review the Dataiku Information Security Policy, available on Dataiku Galaxy.
C. OFF-DUTY USE OF FACILITIES AND SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF
LITERATURE
Employees may not be on Dataiku premises or use Dataiku facilities while not on duty. In general,
employees may not use Dataiku facilities, property, or equipment for personal use; however,
incidental personal use of Dataiku resources is permissible in accordance with the Dataiku
Information Security Policy, available on Dataiku Galaxy. Employees may not solicit or promote
support for any cause or organization in work areas during their working time or during the
working time of employees at whom such activity is directed. Employees may not distribute or
circulate any written or printed material in work areas at any time, or during their working time or
13
during the working time of employees at whom such activity is directed. Under no circumstances
will nonemployees be permitted to solicit or to distribute written material for any purpose on
Dataiku property.
Nothing in this policy should be interpreted to prohibit employees from exercising their rights
under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (or similar local law).
D. SECURITY
Employees should immediately notify their manager, the office manager, or their People Business
Partner when unknown persons are acting in a suspicious manner, in or around the facilities, or
when keys or security passes, are lost or misplaced.
E. HEALTH AND SAFETY
Every Dataiker is responsible for their own safety as well as the safety of others in the workplace.
To achieve our goal of maintaining a safe workplace, everyone must be safety-conscious at all
times.
F. RECREATIONALACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS
Dataiku or its insurer will not be liable for the payment of workers‚Äô compensation benefits for any
injury that arises out of an employee‚Äôs voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social,
or athletic activity that is not part of the employee‚Äôs work-related duties.
G. PANDEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dataiku has adopted Pandemic Policies and Procedures in
the Americas, which are available on the Dataiku Galaxy. These Pandemic Policies and Procedures
also contain Dataiku‚Äôs Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan, which was adopted
in accordance with the New York Health and Essential Rights Act.
Chapter 6. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
A. INSURANCE BENEFITS
Dataiku offers medical, dental, and vision plans, as well as a 401(k) plan to eligible employees.
Please check your Sequoia BSwift account, our Sequoia benefits website
(http://sequoia.bswift.com), your Fidelity 401(k) account and other related documents for more
information. If there is any conflict between this Handbook and plan documents, the plan
documents will govern. Dataiku reserves the right to cancel or change the benefits it offers to its
employees at any time.
B. HOLIDAYS
Dataiku currently observes the following eleven (11) paid holidays per year, which may change
from time to time:
‚óè New Year‚Äôs Day
14
‚óè Martin Luther King Jr. Day
‚óè Presidents‚Äô Day
‚óè Memorial Day
‚óè Juneteenth
‚óè Independence Day
‚óè Labor Day
‚óè Columbus Day / Indigenous Peoples Day
‚óè Thanksgiving Day and the Friday after Thanksgiving
‚óè Christmas Day.
When a holiday falls on a Saturday, it is usually observed on the prior Friday, but if the holiday
falls on a Sunday, it is observed on the following Monday. To be eligible for holiday pay,
non-exempt employees must be regularly scheduled to work on the day on which the holiday is
observed and must work their regularly scheduled working days immediately preceding and
immediately following the holiday, unless an absence on either day is approved in advance, in
writing, by the employee‚Äôs manager.
If an employee is required to travel for Dataiku business or work on a weekend or on an observed
holiday ‚Äî to attend a Dataiku event, for example ‚Äî that employee can email
hr-amer@dataiku.com (copying their manager) to request they be credited with an equivalent day
off at a later date. Granting of such requests is not guaranteed and is at the sole discretion of
Dataiku.
C. VACATION PAY
Regular full-time, and Term Employees who are scheduled to work thirty (30) hours per week or
more are entitled to twenty (20) days of prorated vacation for each year of active service. Active
service commences with an employee‚Äôs first day of work and continues thereafter unless broken by
an absence without pay or a leave of absence. During employees‚Äô first year of employment, their
vacation entitlement is pro-rated based on their hire date. Regular full-time employees and Term
Employees who are scheduled to work thirty (30) hours per week or more accrue vacation as set
forth below. Part-time employees, interns, Term Employees and temporary employees who are
scheduled to work fewer than thirty (30) hours per week do not accrue vacation.
There is a maximum accrual cap of 150% (30 days) of your total annual allotment. Once an
individual has reached the maximum cap, no additional vacation will accrue until they take leave
and reduce their available vacation days beneath the maximum cap. 1/24th of an employee‚Äôs annual
vacation entitlement set forth above accrues semi-monthly, on the 15th day of each calendar month
and on the last day of each calendar month. Within a calendar year, an employee is entitled to ‚Äúgo
into the negative‚Äù with respect to their accrued vacation (in other words, they can take more
vacation than they have accrued up to the date of the vacation) so long as the employee ultimately
does not take more vacation than they are entitled to take for the full calendar year. If an employee
leaves Dataiku for any reason (including, but not limited to, resignation, termination or otherwise)
during the year and that employee has a negative vacation balance as of their last day of work,
Dataiku will deduct the monetary equivalent of such employee‚Äôs negative vacation balance from
the employee‚Äôs final paycheck. Vacation will continue to accrue while you are on a statutorily
15
protected leave (i.e. NY PFL, etc.), but will not accrue while you are on an unpaid leave of
absence. You may not elect to receive pay instead of vacation.
Vacations generally can be taken whenever work schedules permit. All vacation requests must be
approved in advance by your manager by submitting your request in Workday. To calculate your
vacation entitlement, employees should view their ‚ÄúTime Off Balance‚Äù in Workday.
Dataiku reserves the right to adjust an employee‚Äôs vacation entitlement or this vacation policy at
any time. All accrued but unused vacation days are paid out upon the termination of your
employment with Dataiku for any reason or no reason, except as prohibited by applicable law.
D. SICK LEAVE
Dataiku has a Flexible Sick Leave Policy that allows our employees to take paid time off for
medical reasons in an amount that is generally up to each employee (‚ÄúFlexible Sick Leave‚Äù) in
accordance with the below.
Amount and Purpose
The maximum amount of Flexible Sick Leave at any one time under this policy cannot exceed ten
(10) consecutive working days, unless approved by HR. For information about Extended Leaves
of Absence, see below or speak to your People Business Partner about available options.
You may use your sick leave for your own mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition,
for purposes of obtaining a diagnosis, care, or treatment for such illness, injury, or health condition,
or your need to get preventative medical care. You may also use sick leave to care for a family
member who needs preventative medical care, or who needs a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment
for a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition, or for any other purpose under
applicable law. Furthermore, you may use sick leave for ‚ÄúSafe Time,‚Äù as defined by the New York
City Earned Safe and Sick Time Act, or for any other purpose under applicable law.
Notice
When possible, you must provide your supervisor with at least seven (7) days‚Äô notice of your
planned use of Flexible Sick Leave. You may provide this notice in person, by phone, or by
emailing your supervisor, but you must also input any leave in Workday as ‚ÄúSick Leave‚Äù. You
should inform him/her of the date you expect to use sick leave, the number of hours you will use,
and the reason for use of sick leave (i.e. doctor‚Äôs appointment). Under no circumstances will the
Company require you to disclose the details of your, or your family member‚Äôs, injury, illness, or
health condition that required the use of sick leave. If you have less than seven (7) day‚Äôs advance
notice of the need to use Sick Leave, you should notify your supervisor by email as soon as
practicable prior to using sick leave.
Employees who take time off due to illness or injury with absences beyond three (3) consecutive
work days may be required to bring a note from their health care provider releasing the employee
to work. The medical release must list any applicable work limitations. The purpose of this request
is to ensure that an employee‚Äôs absence from work is properly documented and to allow the
employee to use applicable benefits, such as short-term disability or workers‚Äô compensation
16
insurance, where warranted. This documentation must be provided within seven (7) days after the
employee returns to work.
Extended Leave of Absence
All long-term leaves of absence that may qualify as ‚Äúprotected leave‚Äù under applicable law, or that
exceed ten (10) consecutive working days (collectively, ‚ÄúExtended Leaves of Absence‚Äù) must be
requested to HR and will be reviewed pursuant to applicable law. In general, an employee will not
receive pay during an Extended Leave of Absence unless the employee is eligible to receive
benefits under the Company‚Äôs disability insurance, paid parental leave or otherwise under
applicable law.
Miscellaneous
Employees eligible for any other type of paid leave benefits (including, without limitation, paid
holidays, paid parental leave, short term disability benefits, paid family leave, paid parental leave
or workers‚Äô compensation benefits are generally not eligible for Flexible Sick Leave while
receiving such other paid leave benefits. However, if an employee is eligible to receive such
benefits, those benefits will be integrated with any pay the employee may be entitled to receive, or
under the Company‚Äôs other leave policies, so that the employee receives no more than 100% of
his/her regular base salary or wages. Employees who may qualify for other paid leave are required
to apply for such leave benefits in order to be eligible for Company-provided Flexible Sick Leave.
If the Company believes, in its sole discretion, that there is an abusive pattern to absences (like
leaving early every Friday afternoon), supervisors will review this with the employee. Abusive
absences may result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
Because Flexible Sick Leave is not allotted or accrued, there is no concept of ‚Äúunused‚Äù paid sick
leave. Accordingly, employees will not accrue or vest in sick leave. No Flexible Sick Leave will
be paid out upon termination of employment.
The Company reserves the exclusive right to approve, deny, or modify requests for Flexible Sick
Leave in its sole discretion. However, nothing in this policy is intended or should be construed to
abridge or otherwise limit rights under applicable local, city, state, provincial, or federal law,
including, but not limited to, rights under the New York City Earned Safe and Sick Time Act and the
New York Paid Sick Leave law. New York City employees may refer to the Earned Safe and Sick
Time Act notice attached as Attachment 3 to this Handbook.
E. PAID PARENTAL LEAVE
The purpose of paid parental leave under this policy (‚ÄúPaid Parental Leave‚Äù) is to enable the
employee to care for and bond with a new child following the birth of a child, adoption of a child,
or placement of a child in legal custody (each, a ‚ÄúQualifying Event‚Äù).
Eligibility
To be eligible for Paid Parental Leave, eligible employees must meet the following criteria:
‚óè be a full-time employee; and
17
‚óè experienced a Qualifying Event.
To be eligible for Paid Parental Leave, (i) New York employees must apply for and be granted
NY PFL (See Section 7A below for more details) and (ii) employees in other states must apply
for and be granted their applicable state paid family leave. To the extent an employee receives
PFL benefits and Paid Parental Leave concurrently, Dataiku may reduce the amount of
compensation provided under Paid Parental Leave so that in no circumstance an employee receives
more than 100% of the employee‚Äôs regular pay. Alternatively, Dataiku may request reimbursement
from its insurance carrier for PFL benefits due or becoming due when the employee receives full
salary under this policy.
Amount, Time Frame, and Duration of Paid Parental Leave
‚óè Following a Qualifying Event, each employee is eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of
Paid Parental Leave.
‚óè Eligible employees will receive the allotted time of Paid Parental Leave per Qualifying
Event.
‚óè Paid Parental Leave is compensated at one hundred (100) percent of the employee‚Äôs regular
pay. Paid Parental Leave will be paid on regularly scheduled pay dates, less any applicable
taxes.
‚óè Approved Paid Parental Leave may be taken at any time (consecutively or
non-consecutively) during the one (1) year period immediately following the Qualifying
Event. Any unused Paid Parental Leave will be forfeited at the end of the one (1) year
timeframe.
‚óè Upon termination of the individual‚Äôs employment at Dataiku, the individual will not be paid
for any unused Paid Parental Leave for which they may have been eligible, except as
prohibited by law.
‚óè Job protection during an approved leave and reinstatement rights will be governed by
applicable federal, state, and local laws.
Coordination with Other Policies
New York Paid Family Leave and Other State Family Leaves
‚óè In addition to the eligibility requirements provided above, to be eligible for Paid Parental
Leave, (i) New York employees must apply for and be granted New York Paid Family
Leave (‚ÄúNY PFL‚Äù) and (ii) employees in other states must apply for and be granted their
applicable state paid family leave.
‚óè To the extent an employee receives PFL benefits and Paid Parental Leave concurrently,
Dataiku may reduce the amount of compensation provided under Paid Parental Leave so
that in no circumstance an employee receives more than 100% of the employee‚Äôs regular
pay. Alternatively, Dataiku may request reimbursement from its insurance carrier for PFL
benefits due or becoming due when the employee receives full salary under this policy.
‚óè Please refer to the New York Paid Family Leave Policy for further guidance on NY PFL.
Please contact the Total Rewards Team for further guidance for states outside of New York.
Short-Term Disability (‚ÄúSTD‚Äù)
18
‚óè In addition to the eligibility requirements provided above, to be eligible for Paid Parental
Leave, employees who qualify must apply for and be granted STD by Dataiku‚Äôs STD
insurance carrier
‚óè To the extent an employee receives STD benefits and Paid Parental Leave concurrently,
Dataiku may reduce the amount of compensation provided under Paid Parental Leave so
that in no circumstance an employee receives more than 100% of the employee‚Äôs regular
pay.
Other Policies
‚óè Dataiku will maintain all benefits for employees during the Paid Parental Leave period just
as if they were taking any other company paid leave, such as paid vacation leave.
‚óè If a company holiday occurs while the employee is on Paid Parental Leave, such day will be
charged to holiday pay and the total Paid Parental Leave entitlement will not be affected.
Requests for Paid Parental Leave
‚óè The employee will provide his or her manager and HR with notice of the request for leave
at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of the leave (or if the leave was not
foreseeable, as soon as possible).
‚óè The employee must complete the necessary forms and provide all documentation as
required by HR to substantiate the request.
Return to Work
‚óè The employee must provide as much advance notice as possible regarding their expected
return to work date. If an employee cannot return to work after exhausting Paid Parental
Leave, the employee should contact HR to discuss additional options.
We encourage you to plan ahead to ensure that we are able to take care of all of these items so that
you can take time with family and minimize any disruptions. As is the case with all Dataiku
policies, Dataiku has the exclusive right to interpret this policy.
F. WORKERS‚Äô COMPENSATION
Dataiku, in accordance with state law, provides insurance coverage for employees in case of
work-related injury. The workers‚Äô compensation benefits provided to injured employees may
include medical care, cash benefits (tax-free) to replace lost wages, and vocational rehabilitation to
help qualified injured employees return to suitable employment. Employees must immediately
report any work-related injury to their supervisor, seek medical treatment and follow-up care if
required, and complete any required employee claim forms and return them to HR. Employees
must provide Dataiku with a certification from their health care provider regarding the need for
workers‚Äô compensation disability leave and the employee‚Äôs ability to return to work from the leave.
Upon submission of a medical certification that the employee is able to return to work, the
employee will be offered the same position held at the time of leaving, unless the job has been
filled in order to avoid undermining Dataiku‚Äôs ability to operate safely and efficiently, or the
employee is not capable of performing the job responsibilities upon return. If an employee‚Äôs
former position is not available, a substantially similar position will be offered unless there is no
substantially similar position available, filling the available position would substantially undermine
19
Dataiku‚Äôs ability to operate safely and efficiently, or the employee is not capable of performing the
job responsibilities. If, after returning from workers‚Äô compensation disability leave, the employee
is unable to perform the essential functions of the job because of a physical or mental condition,
Dataiku‚Äôs obligations to the employee may include reasonable accommodation, as governed by
applicable law and Dataiku‚Äôs Reasonable Accommodation policy above.
Chapter 7. LEAVE POLICIES
A. NEW YORK PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACT
Eligibility
Employees working in New York are eligible for both wage replacement (NY PFL) and job
security under the New York Paid Family Leave Act (‚ÄúNYPFLA‚Äù). Employees are eligible for NY
PFL if they either (i) work a regular schedule of twenty (20) or more hours per week and have
worked for Dataiku for at least twenty six (26) weeks, or (ii) work a regular schedule of less than
twenty (20) hours per week and have worked for Dataiku for at least one hundred and seventy five
(175) days.
NY PFL can be used in any of the following situations:
1. For the birth of the employee‚Äôs child and to care for such newborn child during the first
twelve (12) months of the child‚Äôs life.
2. For the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care during the first
twelve (12) months after the placement.
3. To care for the employee‚Äôs family member with a serious health condition. Family
members include spouses, domestic partners, children, parents, parents-in-law,
grandparents, and grandchildren. A serious health condition is an illness, injury,
impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either (i) inpatient care in a
hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility; or (ii) continuing treatment or
supervision by a health care provider.
4. To handle obligations arising when a spouse, child, domestic partner, or parent of the
employee is on active military duty abroad or has been notified of an impending call or
order of active military duty abroad, such as making alternative child care arrangements for
a child of the deployed military member, attending certain military ceremonies and
briefings, or making financial or legal arrangements to address the military member‚Äôs
absence.
An eligible employee may apply for up to twelve (12) weeks of insurance benefits, subject to
employee payroll contributions and wage limitations. The amount of Paid Family Leave is equal to
sixty-seven percent (67%) of the employee‚Äôs ‚ÄúAverage Weekly Wage‚Äù (computed by adding wages
in the 12 weeks prior to the start of Paid Family Leave and dividing by 12), up to 67% of New
York State‚Äôs ‚ÄúAverage Weekly Wage,‚Äù which varies from year to year. In 2022, the maximum
weekly benefit is $1,068.36, and in 2023, it increases to $1,688.19.
When the employee is not receiving NYPFLA insurance benefits during an approved leave, the
employee may use any accrued paid leave in accordance with the Dataiku‚Äôs policies.
20
Employee Notice
Employees must provide thirty (30) days‚Äô advance notice of the need for NYPFLA leave when the
need is foreseeable. An employee provides notice by submitting a completed claim package,
including all required documentation, to Dataiku‚Äôs NY PFL insurance carrier within thirty (30)
days prior to their first day of paid leave. When 30 days‚Äô advance notice is not possible, the
employee must provide notice as soon as practicable. Information regarding claim procedures,
including the relevant claim forms, are available through your People Business Partner and/or Total
Rewards. Employees should contact their People Business Partner with questions about the
specific documentation required for the type of leave the employee is taking.
Payroll Contributions
In 2022, NY PFL is paid for by employee payroll contributions of up to 0.511% per pay period, but
no more than $423.71 per year.
Opting Out
If an employee does not expect to work long enough to qualify for NY PFL, the employee may opt
out of paying NY PFL payroll contributions by completing a waiver of benefits form, which can be
found here. This waiver is optional. Employees who complete a waiver will not contribute to NY
PFL through payroll contributions and will not be eligible to take NY PFL. The waiver will be
revoked if the employee meets the eligibility criteria to qualify for NY PFL. Upon becoming
eligible, you may be required to make contributions, including any retroactive amount due from
hire.
Intermittent Leave/Reduced Schedule
Eligible employees may take NYPFLA leave intermittently. The employee must provide Dataiku
with reasonable notice for each day of intermittent leave taken.
Return from Leave
Upon return to work from NY PFL, the employee will be returned to the position that he/she held
when the leave commenced. If that position has been filled, the employee shall be reinstated to an
equivalent position of like status, employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of
employment. An employee will not be reinstated, however, if the employee‚Äôs position has been
eliminated, for example, as part of a department restructuring resulting in layoff or reduction in
force, or the employee would otherwise have been terminated had the employee remained actively
employed.
Benefits
While collecting NY PFL under this policy, Dataiku will continue the employee‚Äôs health benefits;
however, the employee will be required to pay the employee‚Äôs regular premiums contributions
during the unpaid period and will need to make arrangements to do so with HR.
Relation with other Laws and Leaves
21
Where an employee requests leave for a reason covered by both the NYPFLA and the Family and
Medical Leave Act (‚ÄúFMLA‚Äù), the leave simultaneously counts against the employee's entitlement
under both laws. Medical or disability leave granted under the FMLA, but not granted under the
NYPFLA, shall not abridge an employee's right to available leave under, or other protections
granted under, the NYPFLA. If an employee substitutes vacation for PFL, Dataiku can seek
reimbursement from its insurance carrier for the amount of Paid Family benefits.
See Section 6E above for a discussion of how NY PFL and Dataiku‚Äôs Paid Parental Leave work
together.
B. FAMILY/MEDICAL LEAVE
Definition
Family/Medical Leave (‚ÄúFMLA Leave‚Äù) refers to a period when an employee takes time off work
for any of the following reasons: to care for the employee‚Äôs spouse, child, or parent with a serious
health condition; the employee‚Äôs own serious health condition makes the employee unable to
perform the essential functions of his/her position; or to care for an employee‚Äôs newborn child, or a
child placed with an employee for foster care or adoption.
Eligibility and Timeframe
Employees are eligible for FMLA Leave who:
‚óè have worked for the Company for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date on which the
leave is to commence,
‚óè have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12) month period preceding the leave,
and,
‚óè who are employed at a worksite where the Company maintains on the payroll (as of the date
of the leave request), at least fifty (50) part- or full-time employees within 75 miles
(measured in road miles) of the worksite where the employee requesting the leave is
employed.
Eligible employees may take up to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid FMLA Leave
within a twelve (12) month period under the Family and Medical Leave Act (‚ÄúFMLA‚Äù). Time off
from work because of the employee‚Äôs disability due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical
condition, whether paid or unpaid, is counted as time used for FMLA Leave. In cases where both
parents are employed by the Company and the FMLA Leave requested is for the birth, adoption, or
foster care of a child, the Company will not grant more than twelve (12) weeks total of FMLA
Leave between the two employees.
Any leave granted for a FMLA-qualifying reason will be counted as FMLA Leave and will be
considered as part of the twelve (12) workweek entitlement in a twelve (12) month period. This
twelve (12) month period is a ‚Äúrolling‚Äù twelve (12) month period that is measured backward from
the date an employee uses any FMLA leave, such that an employee‚Äôs leave entitlement would be
any balance of the twelve (12) workweek entitlement that has not been used during the
immediately preceding twelve (12) months. Further, a leave taken to care for an employee‚Äôs
newborn child or a child placed with an employee for foster care or adoption must be concluded
within one year of the birth or placement of the child with the employee. There is no carryover of
22
unused leave from one ‚Äúrolling‚Äù twelve (12) month period to the next ‚Äúrolling‚Äù twelve (12) month
period.
Intermittent Leave Requests
Employees may take FMLA Leave intermittently (in blocks of time, or by reducing their normal
weekly or daily work schedule) if the leave is for the serious health condition of the employee‚Äôs
child, parent, or spouse, or of the employee, and the reduced leave schedule is medically necessary
as determined by the health care provider of the person with the serious health condition. The
smallest increment of time that can be used for such leave is one (1) hour.
Any leave taken for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child does not have to be
taken in one continuous period of time.
Procedures
1. Notice of Planned Leave
If the event necessitating the FMLA Leave is based on the expected birth, placement for adoption,
or foster care of the employee‚Äôs child, or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition
of the employee or a family member, the employee must provide notice of at least thirty (30) days‚Äô
advance notice before FMLA Leave is to begin to their People Business Partner. The employee
must consult with the Company regarding the scheduling of any planned medical treatment or
supervision so as to minimize disruption to the operations of the Company. Any such scheduling is
subject to the approval of the health care provider of the employee or the health care provider of
the employee‚Äôs child, parent, or spouse.
If thirty (30) days‚Äô notice is not practicable, notice must be given to the employee‚Äôs People
Business Partner as soon as practicable. Failure to comply with these rules is grounds for, and may
result in, deferral of the required leave until the employee complies with this notice policy.
2. Dataiku Response
Within five business days of receiving the employee‚Äôs notice, Dataiku will provide a response to
the employee‚Äôs request for FMLA Leave. Dataiku‚Äôs response will include, among other items, (1)
whether or not the employee is eligible for FMLA Leave, (2) the employee‚Äôs rights and
responsibilities under the FMLA and (3) if the employee is eligible for FMLA, a request for
certification, as described in more detail below.
Certification of Leave
Certification must be provided to Dataiku within fifteen (15) days of the employee‚Äôs request for
FMLA Leave, unless it is not practicable for the employee to do so. Upon expiration of the
estimated time needed for the FMLA Leave set forth in the certification, the leave will
automatically terminate and the employee will be expected to return to work. If additional FMLA
Leave is required, an employee must, prior to expiration of the FMLA Leave, submit additional
certification to the Company, as set forth below. If an employee fails to return to work immediately
23
after the approved FMLA Leave expires, the employee may be considered to have voluntarily
resigned from the Company.
‚óè Sick Child, Spouse or Parent: If the FMLA Leave is needed to care for a sick child,
spouse, or parent, the employee must provide a certification from the health care provider
that states:
‚óã date of commencement of the serious health condition;
‚óã probable duration of the condition;
‚óã estimated amount of time the health care provider will provide care; and
‚óã confirmation that the serious health condition warrants the participation of the
employee.
‚óè Serious Health Condition: If the FMLA Leave is needed for the employee‚Äôs own serious
health condition, the employee must provide a certification from the health care provider
that states:
‚óã date of commencement of the serious health condition;
‚óã probable duration of the condition; and
‚óã a statement that the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential
functions of his/her position because of the employee‚Äôs serious health condition.
The Company will require certification by the employee‚Äôs health care provider that the
employee is fit to return to work. Failure by the employee to provide this certification will
result in the employee being denied reinstatement until such time as the certificate is
obtained. If the employee does not provide the certification within three (3) business days
after the employee‚Äôs scheduled return date, the employee may be considered to have
voluntarily resigned from the Company.
‚óè Second & Third Opinions: If the FMLA Leave request is because of the employee‚Äôs own
serious health condition, and the Company has reason to doubt the veracity of the
certification, pursuant to the procedure above, the Company may require, at its expense, a
second opinion from a health care provider designated by the Company. The health care
provider designated to provide a second opinion will not be one who is employed on a
regular basis by the Company. If the second opinion differs from the first opinion, the
Company may require, at its expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health
care provider designated or approved jointly by the Company and the employee. The
opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered final and binding on the
Company and the employee.
3. Approval or Denial
Within five business days of receiving the employee‚Äôs certification (and any second/third opinions,
if applicable), Dataiku will provide a response to the employee‚Äôs request for FMLA Leave either
approving or denying the FMLA Leave.
Reinstatement After the Leave Expires
Upon return from FMLA Leave, an employee will be reinstated to his or her original job, or to an
equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions subject to
24
any defense to reinstatement allowed under the law. In addition, an employee‚Äôs use of FMLA
Leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that the employee earned or was
entitled to before using FMLA Leave.
Reinstatement after FMLA Leave may be denied to certain salaried ‚Äúkey‚Äù employees:
‚óè who are among the highest paid ten (10) percent of salaried employees who are employed
within seventy five (75) miles of the worksite at which the employee is employed at the
time of leave request; and
‚óè when the refusal to reinstate is necessary because the employee‚Äôs reinstatement will cause
substantial and grievous economic injury to the Company‚Äôs operations; and
‚óè when the employee is notified of the Company‚Äôs intent to refuse reinstatement at the time
the Company determines the refusal is necessary; and
‚óè in any case in which leave has already begun, the Company will give the employee a
reasonable opportunity to return to work following the notice described above.
Other Employment
An employee on FMLA Leave is not permitted to take on any other employment, even on a
temporary basis, without written authorization from the Company. To do so will result in
termination.
Nondiscrimination
It is the Company‚Äôs policy to be fair and impartial in all its relations with employees or applicants.
The Company will not discriminate against employees or applicants as a result of the approved use
of FMLA Leave or a proper request for such leave.
Benefits Determination For Family/Medical Leave
An employee‚Äôs benefits during a FMLA Leave will be as follows:
‚óè Statutory Paid Family Leave. Employees may be eligible to receive compensation during
FMLA Leave under an applicable state or local Paid Family Leave law, including, but not
limited to the New York State Paid Family Leave Act, the California Paid Family Leave
law, and the Massachusetts Parental Leave Act. FMLA Leave shall run concurrently with
leave taken under other applicable laws.
‚óè Accrued Vacation/Sick Leave. To the extent statutory paid family leave is not applicable
to an employee‚Äôs FMLA Leave, accrued vacation and/or Flexible Sick Leave must be used
during FMLA Leave. If the FMLA Leave is for your own serious health condition, you
must first use your Flexible Sick Leave (subject to our Flexible Sick Leave policy described
herein) before using any accrued vacation during your FMLA Leave. Assuming an
employee has accrued vacation and/or Flexible Sick Leave available, the employee will
continue to receive a paycheck during the FMLA Leave. When all accrued vacation and up
to 10 consecutive Flexible Sick Leave days has been used, then the leave is unpaid, unless
the employee is eligible for and applies and receives, short-term or long-term disability
from Dataiku‚Äôs disability insurers. Vacation and holiday hours continue to accrue during the
leave period.
25
‚óè Health Insurance. Employees will be allowed to continue participating in any health and
welfare benefit plans in which they were enrolled before the first day of the leave (for up to
a maximum of twelve (12) weeks). The continued participation in health benefits begins on
the date unpaid leave first begins under the FMLA. The employee shall continue to be
responsible for their portion of the insurance premium. Payment is due at the same time as
it would be if made by payroll deduction. Alternatively, at an employee‚Äôs request, the
employee‚Äôs premium payments may be paid in one lump-sum at the beginning of the leave
period or on a monthly basis. In some instances, the Company may recover premiums paid
to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work following FMLA
Leave.
C. JURY DUTY
Employees will be paid their full wages during jury duty. The employee should notify the
employee‚Äôs manager of the need for time off for jury duty as soon as a notice or summons from the
court is received. The employee must submit this time off request into Workday and, if requested
by Dataiku, also provide proof of summons. To the extent this policy conflicts with applicable
federal or state law, such applicable law will control.
D. TIME OFF FOR VOTING
On election days, all employees will have a reasonable amount of paid time off to vote. Employees
should work with their manager to ensure that any work disruptions are kept to a minimum. To the
extent this policy conflicts with applicable federal or state law, such applicable law will control.
E. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LEAVE
Employees that have been the victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, any other
crime that causes physical injury or mental injury combined with a threat of physical injury, or any
other crime which directly results in the death of an immediate family member of the employee,
may take paid time off from work pursuant to Dataiku‚Äôs Flexible Sick Leave Policy to attend to
various matters associated with being a victim of such crimes as provided by law, including any of
the following:
‚óè To seek judicial assistance/legal protection, such as obtaining restraining orders or
appearing in court to obtain relief to ensure the employee‚Äôs health, safety, or welfare or that
of her/his child.
‚óè To seek medical attention for injuries caused by the crime or abuse.
‚óè To obtain services from a shelter, program, or crisis center as a result of the crime or abuse.
‚óè To obtain psychological counseling relating to an experience of crime or abuse.
‚óè To participate in safety planning or to take other actions to increase safety from future crime
or abuse.
It is Dataiku‚Äôs policy to be flexible regarding leaves taken under this policy. Dataiku will treat the
employee‚Äôs request with the utmost confidentiality and will not discriminate against an employee
that requests a leave of absence pursuant to this policy. Dataiku will reasonably accommodate a
victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking pursuant to applicable law. Reasonable
accommodation may include the provision of additional leave and/or modification of work
26
scheduling. To the extent this policy conflicts with applicable federal or state law, such applicable
law will control.
F. BONE MARROW LEAVE
Employees may take paid leave pursuant to Dataiku‚Äôs Flexible Sick Leave policy to undergo a
medical procedure to donate bone marrow.‚ÄÇLeave may be taken in order to donate bone marrow as
well as recover from the procedure and for resulting medical care. Dataiku may require verification
by a physician for the purpose and length of each leave requested by the employee to donate bone
marrow. To the extent this policy conflicts with applicable federal or state law, such applicable law
will control.
G. BLOOD DONATION LEAVE
Employees may take a reasonable amount of paid leave to regularly donate blood. Employees must
provide reasonable advance notice of at least two to three working days prior to taking leave.
Dataiku reserves the right to present proof of the blood donation and to require that the leave be
unpaid if Dataiku believes that there is an abusive pattern to the leave. To the extent this policy
conflicts with applicable federal or state law, such applicable law will control.
H. CRIME VICTIMS/WITNESS LEAVE
Employees who are victims of a crime or who are subpoenaed as a witness in a legal proceeding
may take a reasonable amount of paid leave to address the foregoing circumstances, subject to
Dataiku‚Äôs discretion. To the extent practicable, the employee should provide as much notice as
possible before taking leave under this policy. The Company reserves the right to request
verification of an employee‚Äôs participation in legal proceedings, such as a copy of the summons or
subpoena. To the extent this policy conflicts with applicable federal or state law, such applicable
law will control.
I. EMERGENCY RESPONDER LEAVE
Employees who are first responders, including members of volunteer fire departments, volunteer
ambulance squads, volunteer emergency/medical services may take a reasonable amount of paid
leave to attend to these duties when those employees act as first responders during a declared state
of emergency, subject to Dataiku‚Äôs discretion. At Dataiku‚Äôs request, an employee who has been
granted a leave of absence in accordance with this section shall provide a notarized statement from
the head of the volunteer fire department or volunteer ambulance service, as applicable, certifying
the period of time, or times, that the employee responded to any emergency pursuant to this
section. To the extent this policy conflicts with applicable federal or state law, such applicable law
will control.

Last update October 12

Maintained by: Hugo Owen
INTRO
We want to invest in each Dataiker so that they can grow, thrive, and have balance in their life.
We believe in-person interaction is key to keeping us connected and engaged, but we recognize
that everyone has different needs and constraints.
Dataiku strives to accommodate these different working styles and situations. This policy serves
as a guide to help all employees understand the expectations of flexible work at Dataiku.
PHILOSOPHY
The shift to remote work is permanent. Dataikers and candidates alike now expect to be able
to work remotely, at least partly.
In-person interaction is valuable, sometimes even necessary. It is key to keeping us
connected and engaged. Whether planned or spontaneous, professional or leisure-oriented,
in-person interactions reinforce our sense of common purpose and (re)connect us to each other.
Every Dataiker has a specific working style, in-person interaction needs, and
function-specific collaboration needs. ‚ÄúNo one is an island‚Äù, but every Dataiker knows what their
preferred balance is in terms of remote versus in-office work, or in-person versus digital
interaction.
Some functions benefit from more in-person collaboration. Unplanned interactions,
off-the-cuff conversations, and collective brainstorming bring opportunities for more
knowledge-sharing and improved outcomes. This is all the more true for new Dataikers, or
certain junior employees.
Some locations are more adapted to working in the office. Either due to market specificities,
geography, or to Dataiku‚Äôs office footprint, some countries and locations make for an easier
commute.
Managers have a responsibility to deliver on the value that can be found in in-person
collaboration, whether in meetings or conversations. By setting expectations and leading
efficient in-person interactions, managers can influence Dataikers‚Äô chosen working style.
We trust Dataikers, together with their respective managers, to choose what‚Äôs best for
them and for their job. Your work organization should make sense for you and for your
function.
Dataiku will invest in the office experience to encourage employees to commute into the
office and collaborate or socialize in person.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 1
REMOTE WORK POLICY
Remote work categories:
Dataiku implemented four remote work profiles in 2021/22 (Office, Flex, Super-flex, and
Remote). These are now simplified to two:
‚óè Dataikers expected to come into the office at least once a week.This group will be called
Commuters.
‚óè Dataikers expected to come into the office less than once a week.
Dataikers will be allocated to one of the two categories based on their current category,
employment contract, distance from the nearest office, and seniority and tenure. You will be able
to check your remote work category in Workday.
Presence in the office - employees in the ‚ÄúAt least one day a week‚Äù category
Depending on their function and responsibilities, Dataikers have different in-person collaboration
requirements; to maximize interactions with relevant teams, Dataikers in the ‚Äúat least once a
week‚Äù category are expected to come into the office at least on the days and in the amounts
stated here, by team and geo.
These numbers are minimums: the office is always welcome to Dataikers wishing to
commute in more often.
Presence in the office - employees in the ‚ÄúLess than once a week‚Äù category
Dataikers in this category are encouraged to consult with their manager to determine the best
days and cadences to visit a Dataiku office in order to maximize interaction and value to the
organization.
Working at Dataiku is predicated on collaboration across teams; knowledge-sharing and
learning with peers is encouraged. In case of conflict between a Dataiker and their manager
relating to remote work habits, the employee‚Äôs People Business Partner can be asked to
mediate. If no agreement can be found, the manager has final determination.
Personal changes
Personal situations can evolve at any time. We encourage every employee to discuss their
specific needs with their PBP in order to get approval from their manager in case their presence
in the office is preferred or required and they plan to move far away from the closer Dataiku
office, and let their People Business Partner know. Setting expectations and communicating
availability go a long way in removing friction in distributed teams.
You may not change either your country of employment, or your state/province of employment
within your country of employment, without approval from your PBP.
Changes in Office location and availability
The H2FY23 - Dataiku Office Policy explains how Dataiku sets up offices and workplaces,
and how employees can be supported in those offices. Changes to our office footprint worldwide
provide many opportunities for Dataikers to take stock of their remote work habits and consider
changing them.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 2
Employees subject to the Charte T√©l√©travail
Dataikers employed under a French contract and subject to the terms of the ‚ÄúCharte T√©l√©travail‚Äù
will receive a communication from the HR team in the coming weeks detailing any changes to
the ‚ÄúCharte T√©l√©travail‚Äù, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, the ‚ÄúCharte T√©l√©travail‚Äù supersedes
any element in this policy.
WORKING HOURS, ATTENDANCE, & AVAILABILITY
For All Full-Time Employees
Regardless of role or location, all full-time employees are required to work their contractual
hours per week per their employment contract and attend any required quarterly, bi-annual or
annual meetings in person on-site.
Because of the nature of our business, employees are required to be available and expected to
work during the company's standard work hours in the corresponding time-zone for your
location. This ensures we can maintain our reputation of excellent customer service, and
encourages great collaboration among departments within the business.
We endeavor to be very flexible to accommodate appointments, family needs, and other
obligations. For us, it‚Äôs really about the rest of the team knowing if and when you are available,
regardless of your working environment. If you need to shift a start time, leave early, or take a
long lunch, simply talk to your manager and make sure to update your status on all
communication tools accordingly.
Likewise, working remotely does not jeopardize employees‚Äô right to disconnect at the end of
standard work hours.
When working remotely (as soon as you work outside of a Dataiku office)
We trust all of our employees to get their work done. Whether or not you‚Äôre available or ‚Äúonline‚Äù
isn‚Äôt a matter of oversight or a lack of trust; it‚Äôs about being excellent to your teammates and
available should they need you. Your team should know whether or not they can reach you in an
emergency or time of need, and if your work is covered.
Achieving this requires a few additional steps in a remote environment, but here are a few
things we suggest:
1. Zoom standups,
2. Utilizing Slack statuses (out for lunch ‚Ä¶)
3. Diligent use of your calendar and working hours/vacation time settings.
4. Up to date submission of your workday PTO and other non-working periods.
You should also ensure your calendar has regular 1-on-1s and team meetings each week,
giving each team member the opportunity to see one another and meet with their manager.
Dataiku trusts employees to work with the same attention and thoughtfulness they exhibit in the
office while working remotely. If an employee requires a day off (sick, vacation, or other), they
are very welcome to avail themselves of it per their local time off guidelines and to log it properly
in Workday.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 3
COMMUNICATION
When you‚Äôre not next to one another in an office, you should err on the side of
overcommunication. Slack, email, Zoom, phone calls, and numerous other communication
channels are available to you.
Your team and manager will likely have their own expectations for communication and response
times; be sure you know what those are. If those expectations seem unreasonable, please
discuss them with your People Business Partner.
ENVIRONMENT
We recommend that each employee have a designated remote workspace, which is typically a
space in your home (e.g. a desk, an office, a spare bedroom). Your workspace must be kept in a
safe condition, free from hazards to both yourself and the equipment.
If you sustain any injuries in your designated workspace and in conjunction with your regular
work duties, notify your manager as soon as possible. Unless otherwise stated under applicable
law, Dataiku is not responsible for any injuries to the employee or any third parties outside of
your workspace or during the employee‚Äôs non-working time. Additionally, Dataikers are
responsible for ensuring that their designated working arrangement does not potentially
invalidate the terms of their home insurance, mortgage, lease or rental agreement.
If, while working from a designated workspace, the employee experiences technical issues with
their computer or internet access that prevent them from working remotely, notify your manager
right away to ensure coverage of the work and to get support for the issue. Interruptions to work
caused by internet outages may require you to work from the main office or an alternate location
for the remainder of the day or until the outage is fixed.
Likewise, employees must guarantee the space they are working from is free from interruptions
and sound pollution, and that their equipment is up to the task of efficient, smooth audio/video
communication.
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS
The performance expectations for a remote employee are no different than for an in-office
employee. Employees must be able to carry out the same duties, assignments, and other work
obligations while working remotely as they do when working at a Dataiku office.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION
Dataiku supports each employee‚Äôs path to growth, regardless of their work setup. All employees
are encouraged to have regular discussions with their managers and People Business Partners
to discuss their career progression. If an employee is interested in considering a different role at
Dataiku, they can consult the job post related to that role and there should be a clear mention
made of the default team schedule to ensure transparency in the application process.

Refer to the Work From Almost Anywhere (WFAA) Policy for eligibility, more information, and
how to get started!
EXPENSES & COMMUTER REIMBURSEMENT

OTHER
All of Dataiku‚Äôs rules and policies, including those set in our Employee Handbook, apply while
working from a designated workspace. These policies include, but are not limited to, policies
regarding attendance, confidentiality, and policies prohibiting harassment. Employees are
reminded that this remote/work-from-home policy is not to be used in place of leave (e.g. sick
leave). All of our guidelines for employee benefits and compensation remain the same.
The employee is responsible for determining any personal tax or legal implications relating to
the local country, state and local government, and/or restrictions of working partially from an
off-site location. Responsibility for fulfilling all obligations in this area rests solely with the
employee.
Failure to comply with this policy may give rise to disciplinary action.

AMENDING OR TERMINATING THIS POLICY
This policy does not form part of your contract of employment or other contract you have with
Dataiku and Dataiku may amend, update or revoke it at any time for example due to a change in
business needs.
FAQ
What happens if I need to change my habits or move away from a Dataiku office?
Your change in work setup will be evaluated on two criterias: your capacity to deliver great work
autonomously, and the degree of flexibility your job position allows for. Feel free to raise the
topic with your manager, and then loop in your People Business Partner for both of their
approvals. As stated above, your manager can raise an objection to your new remote work
balance. We ask that you try to limit the frequency with which you drastically change your work
setup to once a year.

Dataiku Code of Conduct.pdf,"Dataiku Code of Conduct
The Dataiku Code of Conduct (‚ÄúCode‚Äù) is meant to serve as a guide to all employees of Dataiku (Dataikers). Dataiku is
committed to operating at the highest standards of ethical business conduct, and all of you play a large part in that. This
helps us deliver great products and satisfy our customers. It also helps us hire great people and build a great company.
As you read the Code, please remember that we each have a responsibility to keep the Code in mind and incorporate it
into our daily work. Our Code is a reflection of our values and culture, and should assist you in understanding what is
expected of you as a Dataiker. Also, there may be local laws which differ a bit from what the Code says. In these
instances, local laws will always apply and take precedence over the Code.
Who is this Code for?
You, of course! All Dataikers should know and follow the Code. Not following the Code could result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination in some cases. The Code is also required to be followed by any consultants,
contractors, temporary employees, or others who have been assigned to perform work or services for Dataiku.
Have questions?
If there is anything in this Code that you need clarity on or have questions about please reach out to the People team or
the Legal & Compliance team.
Building a Great Company Requires Great Responsibility From You
We work hard to deliver fantastic products and to build a workplace where Dataikers not only look forward to going to
work each day, but also feel comfortable being themselves. We are all responsible for ensuring that we maintain a high
standard both internally towards our colleagues and outwardly towards our customers and prospects.
All of us must always follow all applicable laws, regulations and Dataiku policies and procedures, cooperate with
investigations internal or external and report any actual or suspected violations of law, rules and Dataiku policies to the
Legal & Compliance team, People team or via the ethics hotline. For example, conflicts of interest and violations of our
Anti-Corruption or Acceptable Use Policy must be reported. Accepting the responsibilities of this Code is a condition of
employment and must be attested to annually by all employees.
For example, customers often trust us with confidential information, including at certain times, personal information.
This trust requires that each of us respect and protect the privacy and security of any confidential information that we
may see or have access to, whether it is coming from a customer or a fellow Dataiker. As a result, we limit access to and
use of personal information and confidential information only to those with a legitimate business purpose and on a need
to know. All Dataikers have a responsibility to take measures to protect confidential information from unauthorized
access. We work hard to implement training, processes and procedures that enable us to conduct business in an ethical
and responsible way in diverse regions around the world. Contact the Legal & Compliance team if you ever have
questions regarding the treatment of confidential information.
We take pride in recognizing feedback and acting on it. We recognize that communication is very important, so if you see
something that needs action, we ask you to say something.
Supporting Your Fellow Dataikers
We are all fully committed to creating a supportive and fun work environment to help all Dataikers perform at a high
level and reach their full potential both personally and professionally. As a result, you are all expected to do your very
best to help us build a respectful culture of collaboration and inclusion without unlawful discrimination, bias, bullying or
harassment.
1. Equal Opportunity Employment ‚Äì Employment with Dataiku is based solely on individual merit and
qualifications relevant to each individual‚Äôs role. We prohibit any type of unlawful employment discrimination
based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin,
age, disability, marital status, military veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Consistent with
these commitments, we will provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities and for
sincerely held religious beliefs, observances, and practices in accordance with our obligations under the law.
2. Harassment and Discrimination ‚Äì We prohibit discrimination and harassment, whether verbal, physical,
visual, or otherwise. If at any point you believe you have been harassed by someone at Dataiku, or by a Dataiku
partner or vendor, you are strongly encouraged to report the incident to your manager or local HR
representative, or both. Dataiku takes these reports seriously and will take appropriate action, when necessary.
For more information on this topic, please review the Respectful and Inclusive Workplace Policy.
3. Drugs and Alcohol ‚Äì Drug and alcohol abuse at the offices, during work hours, or at any Dataiku sponsored
event is prohibited. Dataiku prohibits the use, manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of illegal drugs and
controlled substances in the workplace. While alcohol is not banned at the workplace or work-related events, all
Dataikers must always use good judgment when consuming alcohol. Use of alcohol that leads to impaired
performance, inappropriate behavior, endangers themselves or adversely impacts others, or violates the law is
prohibited. If drug or alcohol use is affecting the performance of an employee or poses a safety threat to others
in the workplace, an investigation may be initiated and disciplinary action may be taken.
4. Safe Workplace ‚Äì Dataiku is committed to a violence-free workplace, and violence or threats of violence will
not be tolerated. If you are aware of any violation to this policy, please contact your manager, local HR
representative, or any member of the management team, immediately.
5. Social Media ‚Äì Your actions online can have consequences at work and must comply with the Social Media
Policy, this Code and all applicable policies. Failure to follow Dataiku policies on social media may result in
disciplinary action. As always, only designated Dataikers can speak publicly on behalf of the company. If you
are asked to comment publicly as a representative of the company please refer all inquiries to Marketing.
Conflicts of Interest
We should all do our very best to avoid situations where we do not act in the best interest of Dataiku by avoiding
conflicts of interest or putting ourselves in positions that appear to be conflicts of interest. If you are ever in a position
where competing loyalties or obligations could result in or be reasonably seen by others as impairing your objective
business judgment by favoring your personal interests including your friends, family, or even yourself to the detriment of
Dataiku or its reputation, this may qualify as a conflict of interest.
Conflicts of interest may arise from: (1) use or misuse of Dataiku confidential information; (2) accepting gifts,
entertainment, or other courtesies in the course of doing business; (3) friends and relatives; coworker relationships; (4)
inventions; (5) business opportunities found via Dataiku; (6) outside employment or side hustles, starting a competing
business; or (7) personal investments.
1. Improper use of Dataiku confidential information ‚Äì You should not use Dataiku confidential
information in a way other than for the intended business purpose for which that confidential information
exists. You must never use Dataiku confidential information for any other purpose, including but not
limited to using our confidential information to benefit you or someone you know, or in any way that
could create the appearance of a personal advantage to you resulting in a conflict of interest. You also
should not use the information you have access to at Dataiku to generate a financial benefit for yourself or
to other business partners. If you find yourself in a situation where there may be a conflict of interest
relating to Dataiku confidential information, please discuss with your manager or the Legal & Compliance
team.
2. Gifts, Entertainment, Etc. ‚Äì Accepting or giving gifts, entertainment, or any other courtesies from or to
a competitor, actual or potential customer or business partner, or government official can create a conflict
of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. It may also violate laws in addition to Dataiku
policies. Please report all potential gifts and entertainment in compliance with Dataiku policies and refer to
the Anti-Corruption Policy for more details.
3. Friends and Relatives; co-worker relationships ‚Äì Avoid participating in any business decision that
involves your relative, spouse / significant other, or close friends. Just because a relative, spouse/significant
other, or close friend works at Dataiku or a Dataiku partner (or even a Dataiku competitor) does not mean
there is any conflict of interest. However, if there is a legitimate business decision that may involve the
other party and yourself, this may present a conflict of interest. For example, while romantic relationships
between co-workers is not prohibited, this can at times create actual or apparent conflicts of interest which
may require changes to work arrangements at the discretion of the Executive Team and based on what is
allowable by your jurisdiction, if necessary.
4. Inventions ‚Äì Development of outside inventions relating to Dataiku‚Äôs existing or anticipated products or
developed using Dataiku‚Äôs resources may create a conflict of interest and be subject to a Nondisclosure
and Invention Assignment Agreement or other employment agreement signed at the time you began
employment with Dataiku. If you have any questions regarding potential conflicts of intellectual property
ownership, please consult with your manager or the Legal & Compliance team.
5. Business Opportunities ‚Äì If a business opportunity was first identified through your work with Dataiku,
this opportunity belongs to Dataiku and not you. In order to disclose a pre-existing business opportunity
or relationship that you believe arose outside of your work with Dataiku please reach out directly to the
Chief Legal Officer.
6. Disclosure of Outside Activities ‚Äì All outside activities, including for example volunteering and paid
employment, that could conflict with your Dataiku employment require prior approval. Please do not
accept employment or advisory positions with Dataiku competitors while still employed at Dataiku as this
presents a conflict of interest. Please disclose all outside activities in Workday and follow the process
outlined in the Policy Regarding Outside Directorships. Please keep in mind that board seats also include
fiduciary obligations, which carry their own set of risks from a conflict of interest perspective. Also, do not
start your own business while still working at Dataiku if it will compete with Dataiku in any way. If you
have questions about a potential conflict of interest as outlined in this section, please reach out to your
manager or the Legal & Compliance team.
7. Personal Investments ‚Äì Please avoid making large personal investments in companies that are Dataiku
competitors or business partners or where you have received material, non-public information about
Dataiku, its competitors or business partners. This does not mean that you cannot make personal
investments, but always consider the potential for a conflict of interest. Always consider whether there is:
(a) any overlap with your role at Dataiku and the company‚Äôs business; (b) size of the investment; (c)
whether the investment is in a public or private company; (d) your ownership percentage in the company;
and (e) your ability to manage or control the company. If you have questions about a potential conflict of
interest as outlined in this section, please reach out to your manager or Legal.
Confidentiality
Most information you receive or have access to while working for Dataiku should be viewed as proprietary and
confidential to the company. Just because information you receive is not specifically labeled as ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù does not
mean you should not view and treat it as confidential. Information you see about Dataiku‚Äôs business, its customers,
partners, relationships, and employees should be treated as confidential at all times. Certain types of company
information, if leaked to the press or competitors, or even to our customers, could really hurt our product launches,
competitive advantage, valuation, and / or standing with investors and shareholders. We must: (a) properly handle all
information about our company and business and not share it outside the company or with anyone not having a
legitimate business need to know the information; (b) properly label, secure, and, if necessary, dispose of confidential
information; (c) safeguard the confidential information of our customers, prospects, partners, and the like, especially if
we receive that confidential information under a nondisclosure agreement; and (d) safeguard our own trade secrets and
confidential intellectual property.
1. Classifying Confidential Info ‚Äì Any confidential information shared within Dataiku should be on a need
to know basis. This means that access should only be given to others ‚Äúas needed‚Äù for a legitimate business
purpose. Before disclosing information or receiving information from a prospect, customer, or partner,
make sure that we have appropriate agreements in place.
2. What If I‚Äôm Not Sure ‚Äì Certain gray areas will of course require you to apply your very best judgment.
For example, passing along any information about Dataiku, our customers, our partners, or our
competitors, which is freely available to the general public already should be okay. However, passing along
information which you know is not yet public is not acceptable. If you need some advice or guidance, do
not hesitate to talk to your manager or the Legal & Compliance team.
3. Conversations with Partners / Customers / Prospects ‚Äì Both parties should sign a nondisclosure
agreement before beginning any serious discussions where you believe confidential information may need
to be exchanged for the parties to reach their business objectives. Even if under a nondisclosure
agreement, only accept and give as much information as needed to accomplish the business objectives at
hand.
4. Dataiku Data ‚Äì You may have access to confidential information at Dataiku that is not related to your
day to day work. You must take all reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Do
not disclose any confidential information, especially financials, product related, technical, or IP
information, without getting the appropriate consent from the Legal & Compliance team and your
manager. When authorized to disclose Dataiku confidential information, be sure to mark it as confidential.
5. Competitors / Former Employers ‚Äì Quite simply, we don‚Äôt want any confidential information that
belongs to competitors or your former employers. If you see an opportunity to use information to
Dataiku‚Äôs advantage, please contact the Legal & Compliance team first to discuss the matter and determine
if we can act on this information.
6. Outside Communications ‚Äì We realize that you may use social media or other online tools both
personally and for work. Please do not disclose confidential information or represent that you speak on
behalf of Dataiku unless you are authorized to do so. The same applies to press communications. Please
check with your manager before accepting public speaking engagements.
Protecting Dataiku
Other than our employees and the amazing contributions they make to Dataiku everyday, the company‚Äôs intellectual
property (which includes our trademarks, logos, copyrights, trade secrets, and general ‚Äúknow how‚Äù) are among our most
valuable assets. Dataiku‚Äôs software and code base is protected by copyright. Any unauthorized use could lead to a serious
loss that would greatly affect the company. As a result, you should not use Dataiku‚Äôs logos, marks, or other proprietary
information for business or commercial ventures without clearance from Marketing. If you suspect misuse of Dataiku‚Äôs
intellectual property, please report it to the Legal & Compliance team.
Please also have respect for the intellectual property of others. Inappropriate use of intellectual property rights belonging
to others may result in fines and penalties to both Dataiku and you. If you find yourself in a position where you are using
proprietary information of those who are not Dataikers, please seek advice from the Legal & Compliance team, and
likewise check with the Legal & Compliance team before developing a product or making product enhancements that
use intellectual property or any content that does not belong to Dataiku. When and if incorporating open source code
into any projects you are working on at Dataiku, please check with the Legal & Compliance team or the CTO.
Dataiku very strongly believes in giving you all that you may need (within reason) to perform your job effectively and
efficiently, as long as you act responsibly. What does that mean? We don‚Äôt care if you want to grab an extra chouquette or
croissant (or bagel). But do not abuse your privileges and use company money, equipment, or any other company
property for purely personal use. If you have any questions about this, please ask your manager or your local People
representative.
Dataiku‚Äôs technological assets (our network, your laptops or any other hardware, and our mobile devices and everything
that resides on them) are very important to the day to day performance of both the company and its employees. If you
think that there has been any violation of the network or any of your devices ‚Äì for example, you lose your laptop or
mobile device or you think there has been some other compromise ‚Äì you must report the incident to IT.
It goes without saying that you should always secure your laptop, other important belongings, as well as your own
personal belongings, even amongst fellow Dataikers at the office. Why? Not just because people may try to steal things
but because people may mistakenly take something as well. Please be mindful of building security and safety devices and
never disable them without authorization. Also, be aware of your surroundings when entering and exiting any Dataiku
office. Make sure all visitors check in with a Dataiku employee.
Anything you do using Dataiku‚Äôs equipment (computers, mobile devices, our network, other hardware and software) or
physically store at the office (documents, etc.) may need to be disclosed to others within and outside the company in
response to a subpoena or warrant or some other court order. Your local laws will dictate if and when this happens, and
how it could occur. Dataiku, in the interest of protecting its employees, customers, and the company itself, may monitor,
access, or disclose employee communications and other information, only as strictly allowed by local laws.
Lastly, some of us as part of their daily duties collect and store personal information from Dataikers (usually HR,
Finance, and the Legal & Compliance team) mostly to make sure that you‚Äôre getting paid and receiving benefits properly.
The relevant people will only access this information in accordance with local laws and only to serve a legitimate
business purpose and on a need-to-know basis.
Responsible Spending
Spending money wisely starts with you. It‚Äôs not just about strictly adhering to a long list of dos and don‚Äôts, it‚Äôs about
having the right mindset and exercising your professional judgment. We all know we need to spend money to make
money ‚Äì yes, even the Finance team knows that, perhaps better than anyone in fact! ‚Äì but we don‚Äôt need to waste money
to make money. In short, we should spend with precision on things that add value to the company, and not spend on
things that don‚Äôt.
Each person (not just those in Finance), can play a big part in making sure money is spent responsibly, that financial
records are accurate and complete, and that internal processes are honored. This comes into play whenever we sign up
for some new software, expense some business spending, sign a new contract, etc. Please stay in full compliance of all
applicable internal processes. If you have questions, please contact a member of the Finance team.
When submitting expenses or when spending money on behalf of Dataiku, make sure that costs are reasonable, directly
related to a business purpose, and properly documented according to the current T&E policy and any other relevant
policies and processes, if applicable. If you are unsure about an expense, always consult with your manager first.
Managers as a result are responsible for all money spent by both their direct reports as well as themselves and should
review expenses carefully.
Each time you desire to enter into a business transaction on behalf of Dataiku, there must be some type of
documentation that records the transaction and is approved by the Legal & Compliance team. Do not sign contracts on
behalf of Dataiku unless all of the following apply: (a) you are an authorized signatory (if you are not sure about this, ask
your manager); (b) the contract or documentation has been approved by the Legal & Compliance team (unless you use a
standard Dataiku form contract that is unchanged); and (c) you have reviewed the document and understand the terms.
Contracts should always be in writing.
As Dataiku grows, we will need to enter into contracts with more suppliers and vendors that provide us services. We
should always try to get the best deal possible (which does not always mean spending the least amount of money).
Quality and service are very important, and the types of terms and conditions imposed may also affect our final decision.
Please have the Legal & Compliance team review all terms and conditions of anything you purchase.
As we grow, we will also accumulate a greater amount of paper and electronic records. It is important that we keep
records for the appropriate amount of time. If applicable to you, a record retention policy will give you and your team
more detail about how long to keep certain records. If we are ever subject to litigation, an audit, or investigation, please
consult with the Legal & Compliance team to determine the right amount of time to retain records.
Doing The Right Thing
It is very important to Dataiku that we all comply with laws and regulations and take our responsibilities seriously in this
regard. We all understand that it is not possible to understand or know every applicable law, but you should keep in mind
any major laws and regulations that apply to your day to day work. Some of them are outlined for you below.
1. Trade Controls ‚Äì U.S. and international trade laws control where Dataiku can sell its products and services.
These laws in general apply to: (a) imports and exports into and out of the U.S.; (b) imports and exports into
and out of other countries, with possible concerns when containing technology of U.S. origin; (c) exports of
services or the provision of services to non-U.S. individuals; (d) exports of technical data, in particular when it
is of U.S. origin. What exactly is an ‚Äúimport‚Äù or ‚Äúexport‚Äù? Good question. For example: access by a non-U.S.
person to U.S. technical data can be an export; permitting download of software from one country to another is
an export; transporting technical data or software on your laptop, or in your baggage could possibly be an
export or import. We should all keep in mind that to the extent you are involved in providing Dataiku products
or services or sending technical data from one country to another, you should work closely with your manager
to ensure that all transactions are allowable by applicable laws. If there is ever a doubt about this issue, please
consult with the Legal & Compliance team.
2. Competition Laws ‚Äì Most countries have antitrust, competition, or unfair competition laws that try to
prohibit restraints on trade, abuses of intellectual property rights, and use of market position to unfairly
disadvantage competitors. Certain conduct is strictly prohibited, such as: (a) fixing prices with competitors; (b)
colluding with competitors to allocate certain customers or markets; (c) boycotting certain suppliers or
customers with competitors. Please assess each individual situation that is presented to you, and if you have any
doubt with regard to whether any competition laws would apply, please consult with the Legal & Compliance
team.
3. Insider Trading Laws ‚Äì You may come across a circumstance where you overhear a conversation or see
something that might not have been intended for you, which involves confidential information. You may also
come across information that is intended for you, but is confidential and should not be used to your advantage.
If you use this information to buy or sell stock, or pass it along to others that end up doing so, this could
qualify as insider trading. Quite simply, if you have that sinking feeling that it feels wrong, don‚Äôt do it.
4. Anti-bribery Laws ‚Äì This one is really simple. Don‚Äôt bribe anyone for any reason. Ever. For more information
regarding anti-bribery, please review the Anti-corruption Policy found here.
5. Government Officials ‚Äì Offering gifts or entertainment to government officials could be tricky because they
could be perceived as bribes. Several laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act
specifically prohibit offering or giving anything of value to government officials to influence an action or secure
for you an improper advantage. This includes gifts, meals, travel, political and charitable contributions, and job
offers to government official relatives. This isn‚Äôt to say we cannot make expenditures to government officials
directly related to promotion of our products or services such as providing a non-extravagant meal after a full
day demo. Payment of any expenses should be pre-approved by the Legal & Compliance team. For more
information regarding government officials, please review the Anti-corruption Policy found here.
Keeping a Safe Environment
Retaliation against any Dataiker or other worker who reports or participates in any investigation of a possible violation
of the Code, or of any other applicable policies or laws, is prohibited. If you believe you have been or are being retaliated
against, please contact your local HR representative, your manager, or a member of the Executive Team.
In Conclusion
As you can all appreciate, Dataiku aspires to be a unique company. It would not be possible to predict or account for
every single scenario that we could possibly face as employees. However, we all uphold a high standard for ourselves and
for our company. To that effect, we expect that Dataiker‚Äôs behavior will be guided by this Code. If you ever have
questions, do not be afraid to ask your manager, People Business Partner, or the Legal & Compliance team.
To raise reports of concerns or violations related to this Code, please report it to your manager, your People Business
Partner, or the Legal & Compliance team. To make reports anonymously, please refer to the Incident Management
Reporting Process for the Ethicspoint reporting procedures.

DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
Effective Date: March 5, 2024
INTRODUCTION
Dataiku believes that a diverse identity is a source of strength and allows us to optimize across the
many dimensions that are needed for our success.
At Dataiku, we want all of our employees to feel valued, respected and encouraged to share
differing perspectives so that people can feel free to be who they are at work.
To that end, Dataiku is committed to providing employees with a respectful and inclusive
professional working environment free of harassment, discrimination, bullying, violence, and
retaliation.
POLICY APPLICATION
We all share the responsibility of upholding a respectful and inclusive workplace. This policy
applies globally to all Dataiku employees without exception, and also to customers, vendors,
contractors, other contingent workers or non-employees who perform business with the Company.
Actions prohibited by this policy are unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related setting
outside the workplace. This includes any physical or virtual setting where business on behalf of
Dataiku is performed, including an employee‚Äôs place(s) of work (including business or home
offices), various communication channels including emails, Slack, video conferencing platforms,
social media, in-person meetings, and any work-related function (including conferences, seminars,
business trips and business-related social events inside or outside the office).
POLICY
All employees and covered individuals are expected to contribute to a respectful and inclusive
workplace and are encouraged to report any behavior that violates this policy that they experience,
observe, or are made aware of. Managers are required to report any complaint they receive or
become aware of to their People Business Partner.
All complaints or escalations will be reviewed and investigated, as needed, and will be treated with
the fullest extent of confidentiality possible. Dataiku prohibits any retaliation against covered
individuals who report or escalate a complaint or participate in an investigation process.
Employees who are found to be in violation of this policy are subject to discipline in accordance
with Dataiku‚Äôs Discipline Policy, which may include but is not limited to termination of
employment. Policy violations by non-employee covered individuals may result in actions such as
removal from the premises or termination of a contract.
This policy further explains the type of conduct that won‚Äôt be tolerated, the responsibilities of
employees, and the multiple ways in which individuals can raise or escalate a concern about
improper conduct under this policy. It also describes generally how concerns are handled and the
Company‚Äôs policy against retaliation. It is subject to local laws, rules and procedures.
Protected Characteristics
Dataiku prohibits discrimination or harassment based on certain protected characteristics.
Protected characteristics may vary by location. These protected characteristics may include actual
or perceived:
Respectful and Inclusive Workplace Policy V 1.0 3
DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
‚óè race, color, ethnicity or national origin;
‚óè age;
‚óè religion or religious belief;
‚óè sex, including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions;
‚óè sexual orientation;
‚óè gender, gender identity, gender expression, transgender status, or sexual stereotypes;
‚óè nationality, immigration status, citizenship, or ancestry;
‚óè marital status;
‚óè protected military or veteran status;
‚óè physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information or characteristics (of an
employee or those of a family member);
‚óè status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; or
‚óè any other basis prohibited under federal, state, or local law.
Discrimination in the Workplace
We are proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. All employment practices are based on
business needs, without regard to Protected Characteristics. This applies to all policies and
procedures related to recruitment and hiring, compensation, benefits, performance, promotion and
termination and all other conditions and terms of employment.
Dataiku prohibits any activity of discrimination against any covered individual in the workplace or
equivalent working environment. Discrimination includes any behavior or conduct that results in an
individual‚Äôs terms and conditions of their employment being adversely affected due to one‚Äôs
Protected Characteristics. Examples of discrimination in the workplace include but are not limited
to, reducing an employee‚Äôs performance rating, not considering an employee for a promotion, or
placing an employee on a performance improvement plan based on their Protected
Characteristics.
Harassment in the Workplace
Harassment includes any unwelcome verbal or physical conduct based on an individual‚Äôs
protected characteristics that creates a hostile or intimidating working environment.
Harassment may present itself in different forms of direct or less direct action. While this list of
examples is not exhaustive, intolerable actions include:
‚óè derogatory or insensitive jokes, pranks, or comments;
‚óè slurs or epithets;
‚óè nonverbal behavior such as staring, leering, or gestures;
‚óè ridiculing or demeaning comments;
‚óè threatening, intimidating, or hostile behavior;
‚óè intentionally misusing an individual‚Äôs preferred pronouns;
‚óè innuendos or veiled threats;
‚óè displaying or sharing offensive images such as posters, videos, photos, cartoons,
screensavers, emails, or drawings that are derogatory;
‚óè offensive comments about appearance, or other personal or physical characteristics, such
as comments on someone‚Äôs physical disability or religious attire; or
‚óè unnecessary or unwanted bodily contact such as blocking normal movement, or physically
interfering with the work of another individual.
Sexual Harassment in the Workplace
Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome verbal or physical conduct which is either directed at
an individual because of that individual‚Äôs gender identity or expression (perceived or actual), or is
Respectful and Inclusive Workplace Policy V 1.0 4
DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment includes harassment on the basis of sex, sexual
orientation, self-identified or perceived sex, gender expression, gender identity, and the status of
being transgender. Sexual harassment includes all forms of gender discrimination, including
gender role stereotyping and treating employees differently because of their gender. Harassment
does not need to be motivated by sexual intent. In some jurisdictions (such as in New York),
harassment does not need to be severe or pervasive to be illegal.
The following describes some of the types of acts that may be unlawful sexual harassment and
that are strictly prohibited. While this list of examples is not exhaustive, intolerable actions include:
‚óè Physical acts of a sexual nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, kissing, hugging,
grabbing, brushing against another employee‚Äôs body, or poking another employee‚Äôs body;
‚óè Unwanted sexual comments, advances, or propositions, such as requests for sexual favors
accompanied by implied or overt threats concerning the target‚Äôs job performance
evaluation, a promotion, or other job benefits; subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome
sexual activities; or repeated requests for dates or romantic gestures, including gift-giving;
‚óè Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks or jokes, or questions and comments about a
person‚Äôs sexuality, sexual experience, or romantic history which create a hostile work
environment. This is not limited to interactions in person. Remarks made over virtual
platforms and in messaging apps when employees are working remotely can create a
similarly hostile work environment;
‚óè Sex stereotyping, which occurs when someone‚Äôs conduct or personality traits are judged
based on other people's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a particular sex
should act or look, including remarks regarding an employee‚Äôs gender expression, such as
wearing a garment typically associated with a different gender identity; or asking
employees to take on traditionally gendered roles;
‚óè Displaying or sharing offensive images such as posters, videos, photos, cartoons,
screensavers, emails, or drawings that are obscene or sexual in nature, including in
settings of a virtual or remote workspace and can include having such materials visible in
the background of one‚Äôs home during a virtual meeting.
‚óè Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that individual‚Äôs sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, such as sabotaging an individual‚Äôs work;
bullying, yelling, or name-calling; intentional misuse of an individual‚Äôs preferred pronouns;
or creating different expectations for individuals based on their perceived identities.
Violence in the Workplace
Dataiku is committed to maintaining a working environment free from violence. Any violence or
threat of violence against any employee, client, vendor, visitor, or other covered individual in or
arising out of the workplace or through any electronic communication systems used at Dataiku is
prohibited. This includes statements or conduct made in jest, any activity that can be perceived as
threatening, or any action that can potentially result in physical harm or damage to an individual,
their belongings or any Dataiku property.
Bullying in the Workplace
‚ÄúBullying‚Äù (i.e. abusive conduct) also violates Dataiku‚Äôs values of respect and inclusion and is also
prohibited. Bullying is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behavior that would make a
reasonable person feel vulnerable, upset, humiliated, undermined or threatened. Bullying can take
the form of physical, verbal and non-verbal conduct.
Examples of potential bullying / abusive conduct:
‚óè Shouting at, being sarcastic towards, ridiculing or demeaning others
‚óè Verbal or nonverbal conduct of a threatening, intimidating, or humiliating nature;
Respectful and Inclusive Workplace Policy V 1.0 5
DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
‚óè Inappropriate, undermining, exaggerated or untrue derogatory remarks about someone‚Äôs
performance, particularly in front of others
‚óè Abuse of authority or power by those in positions of seniority
‚óè Deliberately excluding someone from meetings or communications without good reason, or
encouraging others to do so
Bullying can occur face-to-face, in a group setting, through communication platforms or email, or
through gossip.
Workplace bullying should not be confused with management‚Äôs non-abusive assignment of tasks,
coaching, and reprimanding or taking appropriate disciplinary actions. This policy should not be
interpreted to restrict managers‚Äô reasonable efforts to manage their employees. Legitimate,
reasonable and constructive criticism of a worker‚Äôs performance or behavior, or reasonable
instructions given to employees in the course of their employment, will not amount to bullying or
abusive conduct on their own.
Retaliation
Dataiku prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports, or intends to report, a violation or
suspected violation of this policy or is a participant in the investigation process of a reported claim.
Violations may pertain to harassment, sexual harassment, discrimination, or violence. Retaliation
is any adverse action taken against an individual due to them raising or participating in a claim. A
few examples of retaliation include, but are not limited to, failure to investigate employee
complaints, termination after raising a complaint, giving a negative review after a complaint was
issued, changing your job duties so that you are handling more difficult tasks or a demotion in
duties. Retaliation taken against an individual is a violation of this policy and will be subject to
disciplinary action. If you are experiencing retaliation, be sure to keep track of and report any
instances of retaliation and notify your People Business Partner as soon as possible.
REPORTING AND INVESTIGATION ACTIONS
In France, DATAIKU has set up a specific whistle-blowing procedure in accordance with its legal
obligations under French law.
This procedure ensures that DATAIKU is able to deal effectively with reports of abuse or improper
conduct in the workplace and to protect those who make them.
Consequently, the legal protection provided for whistle-blowers under French law will only apply to
workers whose report is made in accordance with the specific procedure provided for in the
‚ÄúCharte sur la proc√©dure d‚Äôalerte‚Äù.
Violations of this policy will be dealt with promptly and appropriately. Resulting actions may include
disciplinary action including and up to termination, mandatory training, referral to counseling,
monitoring of the offender and/or disciplinary action, reassignment, or temporary suspension
without pay.
Reporting a Concern
Every employee and covered individual has a responsibility to assist with the implementation of
Dataiku‚Äôs policies in support of enforcing Dataiku‚Äôs respectful and inclusive workplace. If you
observe or become aware of improper conduct that might violate this policy, you should
immediately report it. Employees are encouraged, but are not required to, communicate discomfort
Respectful and Inclusive Workplace Policy V 1.0 6
DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
to those whom they feel are engaging in inappropriate conduct. Alternatively, potential violations of
this policy may be reported through any of the following channels:
‚óè You may report the incident, either verbally or in writing, to your manager or any other
manager in the organization that you are comfortable with.
‚óè You may report the incident to a People Business Partner or a member of the DEC team.
‚óã Employees in France can also choose to contact the Social and Economic
Committee (CSE) at cse.dataiku.ext@gmail.com
‚óè You may report the incident anonymously by contacting Ethicspoint.
Responsibilities of a Manager
Dataiku has a higher expectation for managers to comply with and promote a respectful and
inclusive workplace. Like all employees, managers are obligated to act in accordance with this
policy and will be subject to disciplinary action if they engage in, ignore, condone, or act in
violation of this policy (for example, sexual harassment conduct). Additionally, if an employee
reports a concern directly to a manager, they are responsible for escalating that concern to their
People Business Partner immediately. Managers who fail to forward a concern or engage in
retaliatory behaviors towards the employee who raised the concern will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
Management of a Concern
If the reported situation requires an intervention from the People Team, or the CSE member, the
concern will be escalated to the appropriate and trained team to initiate the investigation process
to determine the appropriate resolution. We treat investigations as confidentially as possible, only
disclosing information on a need-to-know basis. We can‚Äôt promise absolute confidentiality as we
may need to disclose some or all of the information we gather to look into and resolve the concern.
The investigation approach of a concern may vary based on the circumstances or local
requirements. As a general process, the investigation team will gather as much detail about the
situation as possible, gather and review documents and data whenever possible, complete a full
review of all the details, and determine an appropriate resolution.
Investigation Process
In support of a respectful and inclusive workplace, Dataiku takes all reported violations of this
policy seriously. Every situation is different and how we approach your concern may vary
depending on local requirements. We commit to conducting inquiries and investigations and taking
appropriate action in a timely manner.
Employees who are asked to participate must cooperate with the investigation process and
provide complete and truthful information throughout the investigation process. During
investigation conversations, notes may be taken or individuals may be asked to document their
information in writing.
1. The investigative process will include individual conversations with those involved in the
situation to understand the full scope of what has happened. This may include individual
conversations with individuals who reported the concern, any witnesses to the situation,
any individual who may have experienced similar circumstances, and any individual(s) who
the concern is being raised about.
2. When applicable, individuals may be asked to provide and submit documentation or data to
corroborate or provide additional context to statements or allegations being made.
Respectful and Inclusive Workplace Policy V 1.0 7
DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
3. During an active investigation, immediate intervention action (such as suspension) may be
required to ensure that no further harm is posed to individuals or the company. If no
intervention is required, all individuals participating in the investigation are expected to
perform their job duties as normal, and keep their involvement in the investigation process
confidential.
4. Once a thorough investigation has been completed, the Company will determine the
appropriate actions to be taken. The resolution and corrective actions will be
communicated to the appropriate parties. The reporting individual will be informed of the
investigation's closing, but may not be informed of the details of the outcome to protect the
confidentiality and privacy of all individuals involved, unless otherwise required by local law.

uninterrupted, duty-free, thirty (30)-minute meal period. This meal period is to begin no later than the
end of the fifth (5th) hour of work. A non-exempt employee who works more than ten (10) hours in a
workday is also entitled to a second uninterrupted, duty-free, thirty (30)-minute meal period. This
second meal period is to begin no later than the end of the tenth (10th) hour of work.
Non-exempt employees are also entitled to one ten (10) minute paid rest period per every four (4) hour
worked, or major fraction thereof, except that no rest period will be provided when an employee works
less than three and one-half hours total in a day. ‚ÄúMajor fraction‚Äù means any period over two hours.
Thus, an employee is entitled to a second paid ten (10) minute rest period for shifts over six hours, a
third paid ten (10) minute rest period for shifts over ten (10) hours, and so forth. Employees are
expected to schedule their rest breaks at their discretion, unless otherwise instructed by their manager.
However, to the extent possible, rest breaks should be scheduled in the middle of each four (4) hour
period of the employee‚Äôs work schedule. Rest periods may not be combined with or added to an
employee‚Äôs meal period, or used to cover tardiness or leaving early. Non-exempt employees are entirely
relieved from duty during their rest period and may leave Company premises.
B. California Family and Medical Leave
The Company provides family and medical leave under the California Family Rights Act (‚ÄúCFRA‚Äù) for
eligible employees (‚ÄúCalifornia Family and Medical Leave‚Äù).
Eligibility and Timeframe
California employees are eligible for California Family and Medical Leave who have worked for the
Company for at least twelve (12) months, and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the twelve
(12) months preceding the leave.
Eligible employees are entitled to up to twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid California Family and
Medical Leave in a twelve (12) month period, measured during the twelve (12) month backward rolling
period preceding the start of the requested leave, for the following purposes:
‚óè Because of the birth of a child of the employee or the child of a registered domestic partner, and
to care for the employee‚Äôs child or the child of a registered domestic partner;
‚óè Because of the placement of a child with the employee in connection with the adoption or foster
care of the child;
‚óè In order to care for a child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered
domestic partner, or the child of a registered domestic partner with a serious health condition;
3
‚óè Because of an employee‚Äôs serious health condition that makes the employee unable to work at all
or to perform one or more of the essential functions of his or her position; and
‚óè Because of a ‚Äúqualifying exigency related to the covered active duty‚Äù or ‚Äúactive duty of an
employee‚Äôs spouse, domestic partner, child or parent in the Reserves of the U.S. Armed Forces or
in the National Guard.
A ‚Äúserious health condition‚Äù is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that
involves either:
‚óè Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, or
‚óè Continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider.
Pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions do not constitute a ‚Äúserious health condition‚Äù
under this policy.
Scheduling Leave
‚óè If the need for a leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide reasonable advance notice. If
the need is not foreseeable, an employee should provide as much notice as is possible, usually
within two or three business days of learning of the need for time off.
‚óè If the need for a leave is foreseeable because of a planned medical treatment or supervision, an
employee should make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment or supervision to avoid
disruption to the Company‚Äôs operations, subject to the approval of the employee‚Äôs or the family
member‚Äôs health care provider.
‚óè California Family and Medical Leave may be taken in one or more periods. Leave taken because
of the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child does not have to be taken in one
continuous period of time, but must be completed within one year of the birth, adoption, or
placement.
‚óè The 12-month period during which 12 workweeks of California Family and Medical Leave will
run concurrently with the 12-month period under the Family and Medical Leave Act (‚ÄúFMLA‚Äù),
and will begin on the date leave taken under the FMLA begins. Any California Family and
Medical Leave the employee takes shall run concurrently with leave taken pursuant to the
FMLA, except for leave taken under the FMLA for disability on account of pregnancy,
childbirth, or related medical conditions. The aggregate amount of leave taken under the CFRA
or the FMLA, or both, except for leave taken for disability on account of pregnancy, childbirth,
or related medical conditions, shall not exceed 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. An
employee is entitled to take California Family and Medical Leave in addition to the leave
provided for under the FMLA, if the employee is otherwise qualified for that leave.
Certification of a Need for a Leave
‚óè Employees who need a California Family and Medical Leave because of their own serious
health condition must provide a written certification signed by a health care provider and
containing the following information: (a) the date on which the serious health condition
commenced, (b) the probable duration of the condition, and (c) a statement that, due to the
serious health condition, the employee is unable to perform the functions of the employee‚Äôs
position. The Company may require that the employee obtain subsequent recertification
regarding the employee‚Äôs serious health condition on a reasonable basis if additional leave is
required.
4
‚óè Employees who need a California Family and Medical Leave because of the serious health
condition of an eligible family member must provide a written certification signed by a health
care provider and containing the following information: (a) the date on which the serious health
condition commenced, (b) the probable duration of the condition, (c) an estimate of the amount
of time that the health care provider believes the employee needs to care for the family member
requiring the care, and (d) a statement that the serious health condition warrants the participation
of a family member to provide care during a period of the treatment or supervision of the
individual requiring care. Upon expiration of the time estimated by the health care provider, the
Company may ask an employee for recertification if additional leave is requested.
‚óè Employees who need a California Family and Medical Leave because of a family military
exigency must provide a written certification signed by the employee.
‚óè If the Company has reason to doubt the validity of a certification of the serious health condition
of the employee, the patient involved may be required to obtain the opinion of a second health
care provider, chosen by the Company and at its expense, concerning any information contained
in the certification. If the second opinion conflicts with the original certification, the Company
may require, at its expense, that the opinion of a jointly approved third health care provider be
obtained. The opinion of the third health care provider will be final and binding. Employees
may obtain copies of these second and third opinions without cost upon request.
Reinstatement
‚óè If an employee and their manager have agreed on a definite date of return, the employee will be
reinstated on that date if they notify the manager in advance that they will be able to return. If
the length of the leave has not been established, or if it is less than the approved leave, the
employee will be returned to work as soon as reasonably practicable. Reasonable extensions of
leave will be considered for approval if the employee supplies proper documentation before the
original expiration date. Failure to report to work upon expiration of leave will be deemed a
voluntary termination.
‚óè To return to work from a leave for the employee‚Äôs own serious health condition, an employee
must provide a release from their health care provider certifying that they are able to resume
work.
‚óè Employees will be reinstated to the position they held before beginning a leave, or will be placed
in an ‚Äúcomparable‚Äù position, or a position that has the same or similar duties and pay, and that
can be performed at the same or similar geographic location as the position held prior to the
leave.
‚óè If an employee is laid off during a leave, their employment will be terminated and the
Company‚Äôs responsibility to continue leave, to maintain group medical plan benefits, and to
reinstate the employee will cease at the time of the layoff.
Compensation
California Family and Medical Leave is generally unpaid. Depending on the purpose of the leave,
employees may be permitted or required to substitute any accrued paid sick leave during an unpaid
leave.
‚óè For the employee‚Äôs own serious health condition:
o Dataiku Flexible Sick Leave may be used.
5
o California employees should apply for California State Disability Insurance (‚ÄúSDI‚Äù)
benefits. SDI forms are generally available from health care providers and are available

‚óè For the serious health condition of an eligible family member:

Paid Parental Leave will run concurrently with California Family and Medical Leave
taken to care for a newborn, adopted child, or newly placed foster child, as applicable.
o California employees should apply for California PFL benefits. PFL forms are available
online at https://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/Options_to_File_for_PFL_Benefits.htm.
o California employees generally must apply for PFL benefits in order to be eligible to
receive the Paid Parental Leave benefit from the Company.
Benefits
‚óè During California Family and Medical Leave, group medical plan coverage for the employee and
dependents will be maintained at the level and under the conditions coverage would have been
provided if the employee had remained continuously employed. The employee taking leave
must make arrangements to pay the employee share of the premium while on leave. Under
certain circumstances, if the employee does not return from leave, the Company can recoup
premium payments from the employee that were paid on the employee‚Äôs behalf during leave.
Group coverage continues up to a maximum of 12 workweeks in a 12-month period.
‚óè During leave, the employee shall retain employee status with the Company, and the leave shall
not constitute a break in service for purposes of seniority or any employee benefit plan. An
employee returning from leave shall return with no less seniority than the employee had when
the leave commenced, for purposes of layoff, recall, promotion, job assignment, and
seniority-related benefits.
‚óè Accrual of benefits will be suspended during any unpaid portion of leave, and will resume upon

who are paid on a salary basis will be paid for any workweek in which the employee performs work. In
addition, employees may be permitted to use vacation for military leave in lieu of unpaid leave.
If you need to take military leave, you must give advance notice of your service obligations to your
supervisor, unless military necessity makes advance notice impossible. Military orders should be
presented to your supervisor and arrangements for leave made as early as possible before the beginning
of leave.
D. New Jersey Family Leave Insurance Policy
The State of New Jersey maintains a paid benefit program for eligible employees who take time off to
tend to the serious health condition of a spouse, child, parent, or domestic partner (as defined under New
Jersey law), or to care for a newborn child, or recently adopted child or foster child. Family Leave
Insurance (‚ÄúNJ FLI‚Äù) is funded by employees through mandatory payroll deductions. The State of New
Jersey is responsible for determining whether an employee is eligible for such benefits. Benefit
16
eligibility does not require that the Company provide the time off. If time off is given, the Company
need not guarantee reinstatement or provide benefits.
Under the law, eligible New Jersey employees may use six (6) weeks of the employee‚Äôs statutory
twenty-six (26) weeks of State-paid FLI for family purposes rather than the employee‚Äôs own disability in
any twelve (12)-month period. Such purposes include:
‚óè Bond with a child during the first twelve (12) months after the child‚Äôs birth, if the covered
individual or the domestic partner or civil union partner of the covered individual, is a biological
parent of the child, or the first twelve (12) months after the placement of the child for adoption
with the covered individual. Child means a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild or legal
ward of a covered individual, child of a domestic partner of the covered individual, or child of a
civil union partner of the covered individual, who is less than nineteen (19) years of age or is
nineteen (19) years of age or older but incapable of self-care because of mental or physical
impairment.
‚óè Care for a family member with a serious health condition supported by a certification provided
by a health care provider. Claims may be filed for six (6) consecutive weeks, for intermittent
weeks or for forty-two (42) intermittent days during a twelve (12) month period beginning with
the first date of the claim. Family member means a child, spouse, domestic partner, civil union
partner or parent of a covered individual.
Employees intending to take leave to bond with a newborn or newly adopted child must provide the
Company with a minimum of thirty (30) days‚Äô notice prior to commencement of the family leave.
Failure by the employee to provide this notice will result in a two (2) week reduction in the claimant‚Äôs
maximum Family Leave Insurance benefits entitlement for the twelve (12)-month period unless the time
of the leave is unforeseeable or the time of the leave changes for unforeseeable reasons.
Employees intending to take leave to care for a seriously ill family member on a continuous,
non-intermittent basis must provide the Company with prior notice of the family leave in a reasonable
and practicable manner, unless an emergency or other unforeseen circumstance precludes prior notice.
Employees intending to take leave to care for a seriously ill family member on an intermittent basis must
provide the Company with a minimum of fifteen (15) days‚Äô notice prior to the commencement of the
intermittent family leave unless an emergency or other unforeseen circumstance precludes prior notice.
The NJ FLI benefits program does not grant employees leave entitlement - rather it establishes a
monetary benefit for which employees may file a claim.
FLI claims are solely the employee‚Äôs responsibility. Claim forms are available from the New Jersey
Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Forms can also be found on-line at
http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/fli/fliindex.html.

TL;DR: Proof of COVID-19 vaccination is no longer required as of November 1, 2022. If you have a confirmed case
of COVID-19, have been exposed to COVID-19 or think you may have COVID-19 symptoms, please work remotely
until at least 5 calendar days have gone by and you have been fever-free for 24 hours without the use for
fever-reducing medicine, your symptoms are improving, or you have remained symptom-free for the 5 days.
1.Purpose and Scope
Dataiku strives to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all Dataikers. This Pandemic Policies and
Procedures document (the ‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù) outlines Dataiku‚Äôs pandemic and airborne disease prevention
plan and applies to all Dataikers based in the Americas and all Dataiku workplaces in the Americas. If
there are any inconsistencies between the requirements of this Policy and the requirements contained
in applicable laws relating to pandemic responses, the requirements contained in applicable local
laws shall prevail.
The three key pillars forming part of this Policy are:
1. Exposure Procedures and Employee Communication;
2. the COVID-19 New York City Vaccine Protocol ‚Äì Americas; and
3. the Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan.

2.Exposure Procedures and Employee Communication
All Dataikers are responsible for complying with the following steps to minimize the spread of
COVID-19:
‚óè Confirmed Case: If a Dataiker has a confirmed case of COVID-19 or another infectious disease,
Dataikers should immediately inform both their supervisor and people@dataiku.com. You will
be required to work remotely and not come into a Dataiku workplace until all of the following
‚ÄúReturn to the Office‚Äù criteria are met: (i) at least 5 calendar days have elapsed from testing
positive for COVID-19 or (ii) you have been fever-free for 24 hours without the use of
fever-reducing medicine and your symptoms are improving. These requirements may be

‚óè Exposure/Symptoms Consistent with COVID-19: If a Dataiker has been exposed to a
co-worker, family member or roommate with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or another
infectious disease, or thinks they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, Dataikers should
work remotely and not come into a Dataiku workplace until the ‚ÄúReturn to the Office‚Äù criteria
detailed above are met, or at least 10 calendar days have passed and show no symptoms of
COVID-19.
‚óè Contact Tracing: In the event that other Dataikers have potentially been exposed to COVID-19

3.COVID-19 New York City Vaccine Protocol
Protocol
As of November 1, 2022, COVID-19 vaccinations are not required for entry to the New York City Dataiku

NYC Vaccine Protocol at any time - by written or verbal notice.
4.Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan
The Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan ‚Äì New York (‚ÄúAIDEPP‚Äù ‚Äì here) is a plan

outbreak and details various infectious disease controls that Dataiku intends to implement in the
event of an infectious disease outbreak. Currently, the AIDEPP only applies to all Dataikers based in
New York and all Dataiku workplaces in New York; however, Dataiku may also apply all or part of this
plan to other Dataiku workplaces in the United States and Canada, in its discretion.

Work from Almost Anywhere (WFAA)
Effective Date February 1, 2023
PHILOSOPHY
Dataiku‚Äôs international Work from Almost Anywhere (WFAA) policy encourages employees
to explore and work around the world! Working abroad promotes opportunities to build closer
relationships with other Dataikers around the world, while having the excitement of exploring
a new country and immersing yourself in a different culture.
INTRODUCTION
This Work From Almost Anywhere policy allows a Dataiker to work temporarily in a location
abroad. This policy does not apply to Dataikers who are looking to permanently change
their home or work locations, or to Dataikers based in the USA who are planning to work in
another state temporarily (4 weeks or less). For US Dataikers planning to work from another
state within the US, please refer to the FAQ at the end of this document.
Dataikers will be able to work from an approved abroad location of their choice for up to four
(4) weeks per caelndar year. Adjoining vacation days must be pre-approved by your
manager and will not count towards the (4) weeks of eligible WFAA time.
During this time, provided that you comply with this policy, there will be no impact on
employment status, compensation, benefits package, and/or contracts, where applicable.
Your existing terms (or local contract, if applicable) and conditions of employment will
continue to apply to you while you are working from almost anywhere. Dataiku will continue
to pay you in your home location, and in its respective currency. You will not be paid in your
WFAA location where you will work remotely on a short, personal trip. Failure to follow the
policy guidelines, including working in an unapproved location or working in an approved
location beyond the agreed return date, may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment.
Dataiku and its representatives reserve the right to refuse or revoke a request or modify the
WFAA policy and its eligibility terms at any time for any reason with or without formal notice,
as long as permitted by applicable local laws.
ELIGIBILITY
‚óè You are a current regular full-time employee (excluding contractors, interns,
apprentices and other training experiences) and have been employed at Dataiku for
at least 3 months or have successfully passed your probation period (in countries
where this is applicable), whichever period is longer;
‚óè You are currently meeting your role‚Äôs performance expectations, and you do not have
any active performance improvement plans or formal disciplinary actions. The
evaluation of the performance level is at the discretion of your manager.
‚óè The inherent requirements of your role permit you to be able to work remotely for the
period of time requested.

WFAA LOCATIONS
Even though it would be great to offer full flexibility and freedom to work anywhere in the
world, there are a few conditions that apply when selecting your destination location.
‚óè You must have work authorization and/or visas for the destination location, if
applicable, which you are entirely responsible for obtaining at your expense. You can
learn more about local requirements for working abroad by visiting your destination‚Äôs
foreign affairs website;

physical safety and security of the company‚Äôs data and equipment in alignment with

connectivity (at your own cost) to perform your job responsibilities without interrupting
or adversely impacting business continuity;
‚óè You commit to working the required core working hours so that you can effectively
collaborate with your key stakeholders. The core working hours must be determined
with your manager before your departure;
‚óè If you choose to visit a local Dataiku office, you are expected to follow all local
policies and procedures;
‚óè Dataikers may not work from destinations on the United Nations Security Council
sanction list in accordance with the Travel with Dataiku Assets section in the

Dataiku at any time. Any exceptions to work in, or otherwise carry Dataiku assets
into, a Restricted Country must be reviewed and receive prior written approval by the
WFAA Committee, which consists of members from the People, IT, and Legal teams.
‚óè Any work locations may be denied at Dataiku's sole discretion.
HOW TO REQUEST WFAA
You (employee) are solely responsible for researching and obtaining any required needs for

personal tax implications and declarations, and/or any other local requirements. Consider
these factors prior to selecting a destination and requesting a WFAA arrangement.

appropriate stakeholders with as much advance notice as possible of your intended

FAQs
Do I have to complete this process if Dataiku is requiring me to travel for a business trip?
No, this process is only required for personal requests to work in locations other than your primary work
location.
I currently work remotely full-time, and working abroad does not impact my role responsibilities or
working hours. Do I still need to complete this process?
Yes, for compliance reasons, if you are working outside of the country/state where Dataiku currently has
your home address or office address registered (in Workday), you still require approval.
Can I add Vacation Time to my WFAA trip to extend my time overseas/in another location?
Yes, Vacation Time will not count towards the 4 weeks allotted for Working from Almost Anywhere.
However, WFAA can only be taken in full day or 8 hour increments. Plan to use full days (8-hours) when
organizing between Vacation and WFAA days on your trip.
What if I have client meetings or business travel during the time I‚Äôd like to request WFAA
internationally?
WFAA requests should only be requested for durations of time in which the business is not requiring you to
travel and your work/team needs are not interrupted by your WFAA trip. WFAA requests may be denied if
you have scheduled business travel or you are needed for in-person engagements. In cases where urgent,
unforeseen business trips arise where you can not attend remotely, all terms of the Travel and Expense
Policy will apply.
How do I know if I will have local tax liabilities and if I‚Äôm legally authorized to work in a particular
country with or without a work visa?
It‚Äôs the responsibility of the employee to confirm by contacting or visiting the official embassy or consulate
websites of the destination country. You may also find these resources helpful: tax-risk map, digital nomad
visas
What happens if my computer or equipment stops working while I‚Äôm abroad?
Get in contact with IT at it@dataiku.com as soon as possible. IT helpdesk will be available during core
business hours to assist. If for some reason, your issue is not repairable remotely, you may be asked to
ship back your equipment for repair. Depending on what country you‚Äôre in and if that country is registered
with our IT service, the IT team will either make arrangements for your equipment to be picked up or will
inform you to ship your equipment back to the appropriate Dataiku office. If required, all shipping costs will
be your responsibility. Additionally, the remainder of your trip will require you to use Vacation Time, and the
WFAA arrangement will no longer apply.
If I need a work visa at my proposed WFAA location, will Dataiku secure the visa for me and can I
expense it?
No, Because WFAA travel is personal travel for reasons personal to the employee all costs and
administration for required visas are at the sole expense of the employee.
I currently work in the USA, and I would like to work remotely in a different state from where I
currently live/work. What do I do?
Chat with your manager! This policy only pertains to working abroad. If you‚Äôd like to travel and work
domestically, you will need your manager‚Äôs approval to ensure you are not interrupting any crucial business
activities.
What happens if circumstances change, or an emergency arises, and I cannot return to my regular
home employment location by my agreed return date (my approved WFAA return date)?
Your WFAA trip is only approved for specific dates. You are expected to return back to work at your regular
place of employment by or before the agreed upon enddate. If there is an emergency change to your travel
plans, communicate with your manager and PBP immediately. Your manager will determine if additional
WFAA time is approved based on the eligibility criteria above. WFAA time will not be approved for more
than 4 weeks per calendar year. If you are required to remain abroad, you may be required to utilize
Vacation Time or unpaid time off, which is subject to your manager‚Äôs approval. Depending on the
circumstances, failing to return to your regular home employment location may result in termination of
employment.

Global Mobility Policy
Effective Date: September 1, 2023
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this document is to outline our global mobility process and guidelines for
international relocation. All relocations are categorized according to 3 relocation types:
Knowledge Transfer, Global Dataiker, and World Traveler.
PHILOSOPHY
Career growth and personal development are an integral part of Dataiku‚Äôs DNA and we want to
ensure all international relocation moves receive fair and consistent consideration, along with
the best possible experience, when exploring global mobility opportunities.
In order to best support global mobility, this policy is designed to ensure that each relocation
case is supported by the business need(s) and employment requirements.
ELIGIBILITY
Dataikers are eligible to be considered for international relocation under the Global Mobility
policy if they meet the following criteria:
‚óè They are currently actively employed by Dataiku as a regular full-time employee;
1
‚óè They have been continuously employed at Dataiku for at least 1 year;
‚óè They have received a ‚ÄòMeets Expectations‚Äô rating or better on their last performance
review; and
‚óè They currently do not or have not had any active performance improvement plan or
formal disciplinary actions within the preceding year.
POLICY
Dataikers may request, or may be offered by Dataiku, to relocate internationally to a country
where the company has a legal entity.
2
Approvals
Each relocation case will be reviewed and go through a round of necessary approvals including,
but not limited to, the employee‚Äôs current and new manager(s), People Business Partner(s), and
Departmental Executive Committee Member(s) or their designee.
Individual cases will be reviewed based on criteria including, but not limited to, business
justification, business needs, our ability and willingness to have a particular role in a specific
2 Dataiku currently has a legal entity in: France, United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, United
States, Canada, Singapore, Australia, and Japan. For the purposes of this policy, Dataiku will not relocate employees to
a country where we do not have a legal entity unless explicitly directed by business need (Knowledge Transfer).
1 For the purposes of this policy, Dataiku means a relevant local entity employing Dataikers in the current home country
under the current employment agreement.
Global Mobility V 1.0 3
DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
country (for example, based on permitted headcount and business activities of the legal entity),
ability to obtain proper work authorization, available budget, and/or impact to business
continuity. If a country's borders are closed for any reason (acts of force majeure, war,
pandemic, etc), immigration processing will not begin until the border reopens.
When all necessary approvals are obtained, the employee must sign a new employment letter,
employment contract, and/or other employment terms and conditions provided to them, and the
employee signs any documentation issued by Dataiku to terminate or transition the previous
employment relationship. Employees who are approved for relocation may not relocate to the
new country until proper work authorization has been obtained.
Dataiku has the sole discretion as to whether any relocation request will be approved and
processed.
Total Compensation Considerations
‚óè An employee‚Äôs compensation package will be based on the destination country‚Äôs market
data and local team pay structure. Note that an employee‚Äôs compensation may increase,
stay the same, or decrease. Dataiku does not guarantee cost of living or net-net
approach in cases of international mobility.
‚óè An employee will be eligible for the destination country‚Äôs local Paid Time Off policies and
local laws. Employees cannot transfer accrued PTO to a new country, but will be paid
out for any accrued, unused time prior to relocating in accordance with local laws.
‚óè Employees will be eligible for the destination country‚Äôs Dataiku local benefits offerings
including any medical insurance and auxiliary benefits. Dataiku makes no commitments
regarding equivalency of benefits between jurisdictions.
Dependent Considerations
‚óè Dataiku will provide visa administration and legally required financial support for
dependents relocating with the employee in accordance with the employee‚Äôs respective
relocation package type.
‚óè Under this policy, a dependent is considered a spouse, domestic partner, civil union, or
3
minor(s) under the same household, as recognized by the destination country.
Employees may be asked to show proof of dependency.
For the purposes of this policy, a ‚Äúcovered traveler‚Äù is defined as the employee and their
dependents who have been approved to relocate by Dataiku. In addition to this policy, all
covered travelers are subject to adhere to the current Travel and Expenses policy terms and
conditions.
Dataiku reserves the right to deny a relocation request or revoke relocation eligibility for any
reason. The relocation must be agreed upon by Dataiku and the employee. This policy can be
modified or suspended at any time with or without formal notice.
3 The definition of a ‚ÄúDependent‚Äù is subject to the immigration policies of the destination country. For example, if the
destination country does not recognize domestic partnerships for immigration purposes, Dataiku will not be able to
support a domestic partnership visa.
Global Mobility V 1.0 4
DATAIKU CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL POLICY - DO NOT SHARE
RELOCATION TYPES
For purposes of this policy, Dataiku characterizes relocations into 3 categories:
Knowledge Transfer
There is a business need to relocate an internal employee to another country based on
their skills, experience at Dataiku, and knowledge of Dataiku‚Äôs products and services.
Dataiku has identified an internal candidate for the role and has asked the employee to
move.
‚óè There is an open REQ in the destination country, or the employee‚Äôs current job ID is
transferring with them with no backfill. The employee‚Äôs current manager, PBP, and the
role‚Äôs hiring manager, as applicable, must all be informed and aligned with the
proposal before being presented to the employee.
‚óè Company initiated; may be an international transfer or international assignment.
Global Dataiker
The employee is interested in an internally open position in another country where
Dataiku is operating and has a legal entity. They apply to the role and receive a local offer
or contract. The employee will be filling an open job requisition.
‚óè There must be an open REQ in the destination country, and the employee will occupy
the role after successfully completing the internal hiring process. The employee‚Äôs

operating and has a legal entity. There may not be a business need for the relocation, but
the move would not cause meaningful business or role interruption.

business approval that the employee‚Äôs job ID can transfer with them with no intention
to backfill in the current country.
‚óè The employee will continue to occupy the same position on the same team and the
move must not interrupt business continuity. The employee is in a remote-eligible role
where the duties of their role are not location specific.
‚óè Employee initiated personal relocation; typically will be an international transfer, in
which case the employee‚Äôs employment in their Home Country will terminate, and will
receive a local offer or contract in the Destination Country.
All relocation packages are contingent upon the employee accepting a formal offer or
employment contract or other employment terms and conditions, as applicable, and their ability
to satisfy all employment eligibility criteria for the destination country.

FAQ
What countries can I relocate to?
We will only consider relocation requests to countries where Dataiku currently has a legal entity. As of
August 2023 these countries are: France, United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates,
United States, Canada, Singapore, Australia, and Japan. For the purposes of this policy, Dataiku will not
relocate employees to a country where we do not have a legal entity unless explicitly directed by business
need (Knowledge Transfer).
Does this policy apply to domestic relocations?
No, this policy only applies to international relocations. If you are looking to relocate domestically, please
reach out to your People Business Partner.
Why does my current employment contract need to be terminated?
When you transfer to another country, your employment contract in your current country will terminate
and you will be employed by the Dataiku entity of the new country.
I am seeking an employee-initiated move. If I want to return after a few years, can I return to my current
job in my current country?
All employee-initiated moves are treated as permanent moves. If you would like to return to your home
country after a few years, there is no guarantee that a position will be available for you. In that instance,
you must request another relocation with the company and all necessary approvals must be obtained
under your new request.
What happens if circumstances change, or an emergency arises, and I cannot relocate as planned?
If any of your circumstances change, please notify your People Business Partner as soon as possible.
There are multiple administrative complexities that may need to be adjusted or halted. We will work with
your situation as much as possible. Outcomes may differ based on individual variables.
How do I know what tax implications result from my relocation?
Dataiku does not provide individual tax advisory services. We strongly encourage you to utilize the Bonus -
Tax Advisory Services as financial assistance to seek professional tax advisory services from an external
firm before relocating to a new country. Among other things, moving to a new country may have tax
implications for your Dataiku equity grants.
‚óè What happens to my BSPCEs if I move abroad?
The vesting of your BSPCE will continue. However, you may face very significant tax consequences
to the extent you are or become subject to taxation in another jurisdiction. These include, without
limitation, losing the tax advantages in France of the BSPCEs, being double taxed on any potential
gain and/or the need to pay additional withholding taxes upon the exercise of the BSPCE. Dataiku
assumes no responsibility for any tax consequences in such circumstances and we strongly
encourage you to consult with a personal tax or legal advisor prior to your move abroad.

UK - On-call duty policy.docx (2).pdf,"UK - On-call duty policy
Effective date: September 1st 2023
1. Purpose
Dataiku has developed a data science platform that is experiencing significant growth. Dataiku's data science
platform provides customers with the tools they need to deliver excellent service, while dramatically reducing
manual work behind the scenes and enabling companies to optimize the processing, cleansing and analysis of
their data.
The specific nature of our business, the practical imperatives of our customers, our internal requirements, and
the competitive environment in which we operate mean that we have to make very high-level commitments
regarding the quality and increased availability of high-value-added IT maintenance and support services.
On-call duties are periods outside of working hours when we need employees to be available to work if urgent
intervention is required.
2. What is an on-call duty period?
A period of on-call duty is defined as a period during which the employee, without being permanently and
immediately at the employer's disposal, is obliged to remain at home or nearby to be able to intervene to carry
out work in the company's service.
There are two parts in the on-call duty:
‚óè the on-call duty: this is the period during which the employee, without being at his place of work and
without being permanently and immediately at his employer's disposal, must be able to intervene to
carry out work for the company.
‚óè the actual work time: Intervention during the on-call period is a period of actual work and gives rise to
compensation under the conditions set out in the present document.
confidential www.dataiku.com 1
3. Scope
3.1. Eligibility
Any employee with a full-time permanent contract can be eligible for on-call duty.
3.2. Use of on-call duty
3.2.1. The IT and Site Reliability Engineering teams require to have on-call duty
3.2.2. On-call periods will be determined according to service requirements.
It is agreed that :
- Firstly, Dataiku intends to give priority to voluntary on-call duty, and to this end, there will be a list of
volunteers in each Dataiku department likely to be affected by on-call duty;
- Secondly, in the absence of a sufficient number of employee volunteers, employees will not be able to
object, except in exceptional cases, for compelling personal and/or family reasons;
- Thirdly, there can be no acquired right to on-call duty for employees likely to be designated, even if they
regularly volunteer, either in terms of the principle or the volume of on-call duty.
In addition, to ensure a regular rotation of on-call employees, Dataiku will:
- arbitrate if there are more volunteers than required;
- in the absence of volunteers, designate the employees concerned by this particular situation.
The information should be shared individually by the manager.
An employee who is asked by management to perform on-call duty may not refuse to do so. Any refusal to
perform on-call time, or any failure to perform on-call time, must be justified by a legitimate reason.
An on-call employee may be replaced by one of his colleagues covered by the on-call regime, provided that he
has informed his line manager of this change at least 48 hours before the replacement takes place, and that his
line manager has expressly agreed to it.
confidential www.dataiku.com 2
4. On-call time periods
Here are the on-call time periods:
Time period On-call time period
Nights from Monday 6 pm to
Saturday 9 am (CET)
From 6 pm to 9 am (CET)
Saturdays and Sundays From Saturday 9 am to
Monday 9 am (CET)
Bank holiday From the morning at 9 am to
the day after at 9 am (CET)
A weekend on-call period may be consecutive to a weekday on-call period.
5. Planning
Individual scheduling of on-call periods is the sole responsibility of management.
Each of the department heads concerned (or their deputy or the N+1 in case of absence) will :
‚óè Draw up a monthly on-call schedule by rotation and in consultation with his team, and send a copy to
the People Ops department and their PBP on the 15th of each month for the following month
‚óè Communicate to each employee concerned his individual monthly on-call schedule 15 days in advance,
barring exceptional circumstances, and in any case at least one working day in advance,
‚óè Communicate to the People Ops department and their PBP the on-call time performed by the employee
to be remunerated by the first Monday of the following month at the latest.
6. On-call employee obligations
The on-call employee should:
‚óè Be available and ready to intervene in the event of an alert
‚óè Remain at home, or in a place with a good Internet connection, to be able to connect to the tools
needed to do the job, to be reached at all times, and able to intervene rapidly.
‚óè Be able to work for the company
Any intervention during the on-call period must be tracked using the tools used in the department, Pagerduty,
and the employee must indicate in the tool in question the end of their intervention.
The company security policy applies during the on-call time period.
confidential www.dataiku.com 3
For each intervention made by an employee, a report is drawn up for this purpose and sent to the line manager
the following day, specifying :
- Date and time of the intervention ;
- Cause of the intervention;
- Precise description, start and end times and duration of the intervention;
- Result obtained.
Reports are forwarded by the line manager to the Human Resources department on the first Monday of the
month following the on-call period.
7. Equipment for the on-call duty
In particular, Dataiku provides employees with the resources they need during on-call duty, enabling them to
work efficiently remotely:
‚óè A professional computer enabling them to access their remote work tools;
‚óè All equipment required for teleworking, as described in the teleworking charter.
The resources made available are subject to change.
Outside this framework, the provision of communication tools by the employer (telephone, computer, tablet,
etc.) to an employee does not mean that the latter is on call. In fact, on-call duty must be explicitly requested by
the employer.
8. On-call duty intervention compensation
An intervention during the on-call period is a period of actual work and gives rise to compensatory time off.
For every 4 hours of actual work, the on-call employee will receive 0.5 days off to be taken in the following
month.
Hours actually worked on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays count double.
Number of actually worked hours Number of compensatory days off
Between 0 and 4 0,5
Between 4 and 8 1
Between 8 and 12 1,5
Example:
An on-call employee works 1,5 hours on Friday from 10 to 11:30 pm. They worked between 0 and 3,5 hours, they get
0,5 days off.
confidential www.dataiku.com 4
An on-call employee works 2 hours on Sunday from 9 to 11 am. As they worked on a Sunday, we count 4 actually
worked hours, they get 1 day off.
9. On-call duty compensation
The on-call period is not a period of actual work, and will therefore not be remunerated as such.
The on-call employee will get:
‚óè Financial compensation in the form of a flat-rate on-call premium for the on-call period itself, to take
account of the availability of the employees concerned outside their working hours;
‚óè Compensatory time off for the actually worked hours
9.1. On-call bonuses
The on-call bonus is defined as follow depending on the time period:
Time period Maximum hours of
on-call coverage
On-call bonus (gross)
Nights from Monday 6
pm to Staurday 9 am
(CET)
From 6 pm to 9 am
(CET)
65¬£ (gross) per night
Saturdays and Sundays From Saturday 9 am to
Monday 9 am (CET)
130¬£ (gross) for 24h
Bank holiday From the morning at 9
am to the following day
at 9 am (CET)
130¬£ (gross) for 24h
The Leadership team can decide to change the amounts of the on-call bonuses every quarter.
This on-call bonus is paid with the salary for the month following the period of on-call duty, unless this is
impractical due to payroll processing deadlines for the month in question.
10. Rest breaks
It‚Äôs reminded that:
‚óè On-call employees should benefit the overall daily and weekly rest breaks.
‚óè The on-call period itself does not interrupt the calculation of daily and weekly rest periods.
confidential www.dataiku.com 5
‚óè Only actual intervention during the on-call period is likely to interrupt the daily or weekly rest period.
Consequently, in the event of an intervention during the on-call period likely to interrupt the daily or
weekly rest period, the interrupted full rest period must be taken by the on-call employee from the end
of the intervention, unless the employee has already benefited from his full daily or weekly rest period
(11 consecutive hours for daily rest, 24 consecutive hours for weekly rest) before the start of the
intervention.
Example 1 :
An on-call employee during the weekend didn‚Äôt intervene. They benefited from their fully weekly rest period.
Example 2 :
An on-call employee during the weekend:
‚óè stops working at 6 pm on Friday
‚óè intervenes on Sunday at 11 pm during 2 hours
They already benefited from their fully weekly rest period before the beginning of the intervention.
This policy will be effective from September 1st 2023.

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTORY POLICIES
A. INTRODUCTION
This Canada Employee Handbook (the ‚ÄúHandbook‚Äù) is designed to familiarize you with the policies,
practices, and benefits of Dataiku Canada Ltd. (‚ÄúDataiku‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) specific to employees in
Canada. Please read it together with other Dataiku global policies, practices, and procedures (‚ÄúDataiku
Global Policies‚Äù). If there are any inconsistencies between any Dataiku Global Policies and this Handbook,
the policies, practices, and benefits set out in this Handbook prevail.
All Canada employees are required to read and understand the provisions of the Handbook. All Canada
employees are required to comply with the policies and procedures set out in this Handbook. Any breach of
Dataiku‚Äôs policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment. Circumstances will undoubtedly require that the policies, practices, and benefits described in
the Handbook change from time to time. Accordingly, Dataiku reserves the right to revise, modify, rescind,
delete, or add to the provisions of this Handbook at any time without notice in its sole and absolute
discretion, as permitted by applicable law.
As copies of this Handbook will only be re-distributed periodically, the most current version will always be
available on the Dataiku Galaxy.
B. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
Dataiku is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions on the basis of merit and
business needs. Dataiku is committed to providing a workplace that is free from unlawful discrimination.
Dataiku does not unlawfully discriminate against, nor does it tolerate unlawful discrimination by, any person,
including, but not limited to, non-managerial and managerial employees and third parties, on the basis of
race, colour, creed (religion), ethnic origin, citizenship, marital status, age, place of origin, ancestry,
disability, family status, gender identity, gender expression, sex, sexual orientation, record of offenses or any
other basis protected by applicable provincial or territorial law. Dataiku prohibits unlawful discrimination
based on any of these protected grounds, as well as any bases or grounds protected by applicable law. This
policy applies to all terms of employment including, but not limited to, hiring, training, promotion, discipline,
compensation, benefits and termination of employment.
Dataiku also prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful discrimination against employees and protected persons
who are perceived to have any of these characteristics.
C. ACCESSIBILITY
Dataiku Canada Ltd‚Äôs Accessibility Policy (the ‚ÄúCanada Accessibility Policy.‚Äù), which is applicable to all
Dataiku Canada Ltd employees, is available on the Dataiku Galaxy.
D. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
Dataiku does not tolerate unlawful discrimination in employment against otherwise qualified applicants and
employees on the basis of any protected ground under provincial or territorial law, nor does Dataiku tolerate
discrimination based on a perception of, or association with, any protected ground. Accordingly, Dataiku is
3
committed to making every reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of its employees in accordance with
applicable provincial and territorial human rights legislation. A reasonable accommodation might be an
adjustment to the work environment or an adjustment to the manner or circumstances under which the
essential functions of the job are performed, as determined on a case-by-case basis. All employees are
required to perform the essential functions of their jobs.
It is the responsibility of any employee who believes that they require accommodation to make his/her need
for reasonable accommodation known to Dataiku by contacting their manager or People Business Partner.
Any manager who learns that an employee may need accommodation should also contact their People
Business Partner, who will help determine what accommodations may be reasonable and effective. Dataiku
is committed to responding to accommodation requests in a timely, confidential and sensitive manner.
Upon receiving a request for an accommodation, Dataiku will engage with the employee in what is known
as the ‚Äúinteractive process and cooperative dialogue.‚Äù The purpose of the interactive process and cooperative
dialogue is to understand the needs of the employee and, based on the circumstances, to identify any
potential reasonable accommodations. In accordance with applicable law, Dataiku may require that the
employee provide medical documentation confirming that the employee needs reasonable accommodation.
Information and documentation regarding an employee‚Äôs need for reasonable accommodation shall be kept
confidential in accordance with applicable law.
Upon reaching a final determination at the conclusion of the interactive process and cooperative dialogue,
Dataiku will provide the requesting employee with a final determination in writing, identifying each
accommodation granted or denied.
E. POLICIES PROHIBITING HARASSMENT, VIOLENCE,
DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION
Global Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy
Dataiku‚Äôs global Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy (the ‚ÄúGlobal Harassment Policy‚Äù), which
is applicable to all Dataiku employees, is available on the Dataiku Galaxy. In addition to the Global
Harassment Policy, the Canada Workplace Violence/Harrassment Policy and Program also applies to all
Canada employees. In the event of a conflict between the Global Harassment Policy and the Canada
Workplace Violence/Harrassment Policy and Program the Canada policy will control.

G. PROTECTED ACTIVITY NOT PROHIBITED
Nothing in this Handbook limits or prohibits employees from engaging for a lawful purpose in any
‚ÄúProtected Activity.‚Äù ‚ÄúProtected Activity‚Äù means filing a charge or complaint with, or otherwise
communicating, cooperating, or participating with, any provincial, federal, or other governmental agency.
Notwithstanding any other policies in this Handbook (or elsewhere), employees are not required to obtain
authorization from Dataiku prior to disclosing information to, or communicating with, such agencies, nor are
employees obligated to advise Dataiku on any such disclosures or communications. Notwithstanding, in
making any such disclosures or communications, employees must take all reasonable precautions to prevent
any unauthorized use or disclosure of any information that may constitute Dataiku confidential information
to any parties other than the relevant government agencies. ‚ÄúProtected Activity‚Äù does not include the
disclosure of any Dataiku solicitor-client privileged communications; any such disclosure, without Dataiku‚Äôs
written consent, violates Dataiku policy. Employees may keep a copy of this Handbook after termination of
employment. No individual will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or provincial trade
secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made in confidence to a federal, provincial, or local
government official (directly or indirectly) or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or
investigating a suspected violation of law, or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit
or other proceeding if (and only if) such filing is made under seal. In addition, an individual who files a
lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret
to the individual‚Äôs attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the individual files
any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant
to court order.
Chapter 2. BENEFITS, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, AND WAGES
A. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY
The eligibility for all Dataikers to participate in any employee benefit plans and programs are subject to the
eligibility requirements, enrollment criteria, and the other terms and conditions of such plans and programs.
Regular full-time employees generally qualify for all such benefits.
B. EXEMPT AND NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES
Exempt employees are all employees who are classified as exempt from the overtime provisions of
applicable provincial employment standards legislation. Non-exempt employees are all employees who are
covered by the overtime provisions of applicable provincial employment standards legislation. Non-exempt
employees may be required to submit a timesheet displaying regular and overtime hours worked within a
pay priod.
C. PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
The law requires that Dataiku withhold income taxes, Employment Insurance premiums, and Canada Pension
Plan contributions from employees‚Äô wages. Additionally, in Quebec, other source deduction rules apply to
employee contributions including Quebec Pension Plan and the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. Dataiku will
take other deductions from wages as required by law. Payroll deductions are shown on the pay statement that
is provided to each employee at the end of each pay period. Dataiku prohibits improper deductions from
employee wages. If an employee believes that an improper deduction has been made from their wages,
employees should immediately report this information to the People Operations Team (people@dataiku.com).
5
Reports of improper deductions will be promptly investigated. If it is determined that an improper deduction
has occurred, employees will be promptly reimbursed.
Chapter 3. EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AND CONDUCT
A. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
Dataiku provides ongoing guidance to help employees meet job expectations and continue to grow in the
workplace. To achieve these goals, employees will receive periodic performance reviews, which Dataiku
typically conducts twice a year. Performance evaluations may review factors such as the quality and quantity
of work, knowledge of the job, initiative, work attitude, and attitude toward others. Performance evaluations
should help employees become aware of their progress and areas for improvement. A good performance
evaluation does not guarantee any increase in compensation and increases in compensation are entirely at
Dataiku‚Äôs discretion and may not occur every year. Employee accessibility needs and individual
accommodation plans will be taken into account at all stages of the performance evaluation process. If an
employee has concerns about accommodation arising out of any process under this policy, the employee
should discuss the matter with their direct manager or their People Business Partner as soon as possible.
B. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
While employed by Dataiku, employees are expected to devote their energies to their jobs with Dataiku. For
this reason, second jobs are strongly discouraged. The following types of outside employment are strictly
prohibited: employment that conflicts with an employee‚Äôs work schedule, duties, or responsibilities;
employment that creates a conflict of interest or is incompatible with an employee‚Äôs employment with
Dataiku; employment that interferes with the protection of Dataiku‚Äôs proprietary or confidential information;
employment that impairs or has a detrimental effect on an employee‚Äôs work performance; employment that
requires an employee to conduct work or related activities for outside employment on or using Dataiku‚Äôs
property (i.e., facilities or equipment) or during an employee‚Äôs working hours; and employment that directly
or indirectly competes with the business or the interests of Dataiku. Employees who wish to engage in
outside employment that may conflict with this policy must submit a written request to Dataiku explaining
the details of the outside employment. If the outside employment is authorized, Dataiku assumes no
responsibility for the outside employment. Dataiku does not provide workers‚Äô compensation coverage or any
other benefit for injuries occurring from, or arising out of, outside employment. Dataiku can revoke
authorization to engage in outside employment at any time where Dataiku reasonably believes that the
employee‚Äôs outside employment may conflict or potentially conflict with this policy .
C. WORKPLACE IMPAIRMENT
Dataiku is focused on providing safe and healthy working conditions for all Dataikers and, accordingly, is
committed to providing employees with a workplace that is free of impairment.
For the purpose of this policy, ‚ÄúImpairment‚Äù may mean:
1. Suffering from extreme levels of fatigue;
2. Under the influence of prescription medications that cause an impairment; or
6
3. Under the influence of legal or illegal, recreational substances (including alcohol or drugs).
While alcohol is permitted in our offices, all Dataikers should use proper judgment when consuming alcohol,
and this policy should be read to apply to circumstances where consuming alcohol impairs work performance
or results in other inappropriate behavior that can endanger themselves or others (including Dataikers and
third parties), or that violates applicable laws or other Dataiku policies.
Dataiku prohibits the use of drugs or substances and being under the influence of drugs or substances on
Company property and reporting to work or performing work while suffering from an impairment (including
while conducting Company business or during working hours). Working while impaired is incompatible with
the health, safety, efficiency and success of Dataiku. Employees who are impaired on the job compromise
Dataiku‚Äôs interests, endanger the employee‚Äôs own health and safety, endanger the health and safety of others,
and can cause other work-related issues (i.e. absenteeism, tardiness, substandard job performance, increased
workloads for coworkers, behaviour that disrupts other employees and disruption of relationships with
Dataiku‚Äôs customers).
Employees must act responsibly with regard to the use of medications, whether over the counter or prescribed
by a physician, to prevent adverse effects on work performance. Employees are expected to consult a
physician or pharmacist when the potential effects of using a medication, or combination of medications, on
work performance are unknown. Medication will not be considered contrary to this policy on workplace
impairment if:
‚óè The employee is using the medication for its intended purpose and in the manner directed by the
employee‚Äôs physician, pharmacist and/or manufacturer of the drug; and
‚óè The use of the medication does not adversely affect the employee‚Äôs ability to adequately and safely
perform their duties.
Despite the foregoing, employees are required to obtain approval from Dataiku prior to attending work under
the influence of any medication that may cause impairment. In those circumstances, Dataiku will provide
accommodation to the point of undue hardship. Violation of the above rules and standards of conduct will not
be tolerated, and may result in discipline up to and including termination of employment, subject to
applicable law.
Dataiku recognizes that drug and alcohol abuse is a serious problem and wishes to assist employees who
recognize that they have a problem with drugs or alcohol that may interfere with their ability to perform their
job in a satisfactory manner. Dataiku is committed to accommodating employees affected by a disability,
including substance abuse or dependency, in accordance with applicable human rights legislation. Employees
are encouraged to request assistance from their supervisor or their People Business Partner if they have
concerns about substance abuse or dependency. Dataiku will make reasonable efforts to keep any requests for
assistance confidential. Employees that request assistance and decide to enroll voluntarily in an alcohol or
drug rehabilitation program may be given unpaid time away from work to participate in the program unless it
would result in an undue hardship to the Company to provide the time off.
Employees may be required to comply with certain terms and conditions that govern their return to or
attendance at work following treatment in relation to substance abuse or dependency.
7
Employees are encouraged to report, on a strictly confidential basis, any work situation where the possession
or consumption of substances is undertaken and could compromise the health and safety of persons,
equipment or Company property.
D. PUNCTUALITY AND ATTENDANCE
Employees are expected to report to work on time and be prepared to start work. If employees are unable to
report to work on any particular day, employees must promptly speak with their supervisor as soon as
possible before the time they are scheduled to begin working for that day. If employees know, in advance,
that they are going to be absent, employees must schedule the absence with their supervisor as soon as
possible in advance of such absence (which generally should be at least one week in advance). Employees
are also required to contact their supervisor for each additional day of absence unless they have submitted a
note from a physician certifying their illness or other similar issue or have otherwise been relieved of this
obligation by their supervisor. Excessive absences, abuse of Dataiku‚Äôs leave policies, failure to report
absences on time, and excessive tardiness may lead to discipline, up to, and including, termination of
employment.
E. CONFIDENTIALITY
As a condition of employment, each employee must execute a Non-Disclosure and Invention Assignment
Agreement prior to beginning employment with Dataiku. Employees are responsible for safeguarding
confidential information obtained in connection with their employment. In the course of their work,
employees may have access to confidential information regarding Dataiku, its suppliers, its customers,
employees, or other third parties. Employees must not (i) use any such information unless it is necessary for
them to do so in the performance of their employment duties and/or (ii) reveal or divulge any such
information except to persons authorized by Dataiku to receive this information. Access to confidential
information should be on a ‚Äúneed-to-know‚Äù basis and must be authorized by employees‚Äô supervisors or the
Legal Team. An employee‚Äôs obligation to maintain the confidentiality of this information continues after
termination of employment. Any breach of this policy will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary or
legal action against the breaching employee.
F. BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Dataiku values its reputation for honesty, integrity, and high ethical standards and all employees are required
to adhere to Dataiku‚Äôs Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedures, available on the Dataiku Galaxy.
G. TELEPHONE AND DEVICE POLICY
Employees are required to comply with all laws regarding the use of phones while driving, including laws
prohibiting text messaging while driving. Under no circumstances are employees required to answer the
phone to conduct Company business while driving. Whenever possible, employees should not make or
receive calls while driving. If employees do make calls while driving, they must use a hands-free device.
Employees may not send work-related emails or text messages while driving. Under no circumstances
should employees use wireless phones during adverse weather or difficult traffic conditions. Employees who
violate this policy will be considered to be operating outside the course and scope of their employment. Any
violations of this policy will subject employees to disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination of
employment.
8
H. OTHER PROHIBITED CONDUCT
The following conduct is also prohibited and will not be tolerated by Dataiku: (1) stealing or removing,
without permission, Dataiku property or property of another employee, a customer, or a visitor; (2) violating
any Dataiku safety or security rule, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules; (3)
falsifying employment records, employment information, or other Dataiku records; (4) unauthorized use of
Dataiku equipment, time, materials, or facilities; (5) deliberate destruction or damage to any Dataiku
property or the property of any employee, customer, or visitor; (6) insubordination, including, but not
limited to, failure or refusal to obey the instructions of a supervisor or the use of abusive or threatening
language toward a supervisor; (7) failing to promptly report to a supervisor the loss of, or known
malfunctioning of, tools or equipment, electrical or mechanical; (8) working unauthorized overtime; (9)
refusing to work, save and except where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the work may put
themselves or any third party at risk of harm, in which case the employee shall immediately notify their
supervisor; and (10) bringing weapons of any kind into a Dataiku workplace. The foregoing list merely
contains examples of conduct that may lead to disciplinary action. It does not constitute a complete list of all
types of conduct that can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment
(‚ÄúProhibited Conduct‚Äô). Failure to impose discipline or any sanctions by Dataiku for Prohibited Conduct is
not a waiver or condonation of such Prohibited Conduct. Dataiku shall consider all relevant circumstances in
each case before implementing any discipline or sanction.

D. DISCRETIONARY SICK LEAVE
Dataiku has a Discretionary Sick Leave that allows our employees to take paid time off for medical reasons
in accordance with the terms and conditions below. Discretionary Sick Leave is provided to employees at the
sole discretion of the Company unless otherwise required by law.
Where any entitlement to Discretionary Sick Leave overlaps with an employee‚Äôs entitlement to a statutory,
job protected leave of absence under the applicable provincial employment standards legislation, the
employee will be deemed to have taken their statutory, job protected leave of absence in accordance with the
applicable provincial employment standards legislation.
Eligibility
Employees may take Discretionary Sick Leave for their own mental or physical illness, injury, or health
condition, for the purposes of obtaining a diagnosis, care, or treatment for such illness, injury, or health
condition, or the employee‚Äôs need to get preventative medical care. Employees may also take Discretionary
Sick Leave to care for a family member who needs preventative medical care, or who needs a medical
diagnosis, care, or treatment for a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition, or for any other
purpose under applicable provincial employment standards legislation. ‚ÄúFamily member‚Äù for the purposes of
this policy includes spouses, domestic partners, children (regardless of age), parents (including step-parents
and parents-in-law), grandparents and siblings. Any prolonged discretionary Sick Leave may be required to
be used in combitation or overlap with Statutory Leaves of Absence where applicable. Please see Section
6.A. for more information regarding Statutory Leaves of Absence.
The maximum amount of Discretionary Sick Leave that an employee can take at any one time under this
policy cannot exceed ten (10) consecutive working days, unless approved by your regional People Ops team.
Paid sick time is taken in place of, and not in addition to any similar leave required by statute.
Notice
When possible, employees must provide their manager with at least seven (7) days‚Äô notice of their planned
use of Discretionary Sick Leave. Employees may provide this notice in person, by phone, or by emailing
their manager. Employees must also input any leave in Workday as ‚ÄúDiscretionary Sick Leave‚Äù. Employees
should inform their manager of the date they expect to take Discretionary Sick Leave, the number of hours
they will use, and the reason for use of Discretionary Sick Leave (i.e. doctor‚Äôs appointment). If the employee
has less than seven (7) day‚Äôs advance notice of the need to use Discretionary Sick Leave, the employee
should notify their manager by email as soon as practicable prior to taking Discretionary Sick Leave.
Employees may be required to provide documentation to the regional People team in support of
Discretionary Sick Leave taken (i.e. a doctor‚Äôs note) if they take sick time of more than three (3) consecutive
work days, and as permitted by law.
Miscellaneous
Failing to comply with the terms and conditions of the Discretionary Sick Leave policy (i.e. taking
Discretionary Sick Leave for reasons that do not meet the eligibility criteria set out above) may result in
discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
13
Because Discretionary Sick Leave is not allotted or accrued, there is no concept of ‚Äúunused‚Äù Discretionary
Sick Leave. Accordingly, employees will not accrue Discretionary Sick Leave. No Discretionary Sick Leave
will be paid out upon termination of employment.
The Company reserves the exclusive right to approve, deny, or modify requests for Discretionary Sick Leave.
E. WORKERS‚Äô COMPENSATION
Dataiku, in accordance with applicable provincial or territorial law , provides insurance coverage for
employees in case of work-related injury. The workers‚Äô compensation benefits provided to injured employees
may include medical care, cash benefits (tax-free) to replace lost wages, and vocational rehabilitation to help
qualified injured employees return to suitable employment. Employees must immediately report any
work-related injury to their supervisor, seek medical treatment and follow-up care if required, and complete
any required employee claim forms and return them to the regional People Operations and People Business
Partner teams. Employees must provide Dataiku with a certification from their health care provider regarding
the need for workers‚Äô compensation disability leave and the employee‚Äôs ability to return to work from the
leave.
Upon submission of a medical certification that the employee is able to return to work, the employee will be
offered the same position held at the time of leaving, unless the job has been filled in order to avoid
undermining Dataiku‚Äôs ability to operate safely and efficiently, or the employee is not capable of performing
the job responsibilities upon return. If an employee‚Äôs former position is not available, a substantially similar
position will be offered unless there is no substantially similar position available, filling the available position
would substantially undermine Dataiku‚Äôs ability to operate safely and efficiently, or the employee is not
capable of performing the job responsibilities. If, after returning from workers‚Äô compensation disability
leave, the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the job because of a physical or mental
condition, Dataiku‚Äôs obligations to the employee may include reasonable accommodation, as governed by
applicable law and Dataiku‚Äôs Reasonable Accommodation policy above.
Chapter 6. STATUTORY LEAVES OF ABSENCES
A. STATUTORY LEAVES OF ABSENCES
All Dataiku employees are entitled to take any job-protected, statutory leaves of absence provided for under
applicable provincial employment standards legislation. Your length of service will continue to accrue during
any leave of absence. Statutory leaves of absence are generally unpaid, unless the applicable provincial
employment standards legislation requires paid leave or unless otherwise specified in this Handbook. If an
employee applies and is approved for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, Dataiku will top up the provided EI
benefit in order to provide full continuation of the employee‚Äôs base salary for up to twelve (12) weeks.
Employees that take statutory, job-protected leaves of absence will be afforded all entitlements and protections
under the applicable provincial employment standards legislation. As noted in this Handbook, employees will
also be entitled to take certain non-statutory leaves of absence at the sole discretion of the Company. For more
information about the statutory, job-protected leaves of absence provided for under the applicable provincial
employment standards legislation, please contact your People Business Partner. Please contact your People
Business Partner before taking any leave of absence to discuss your rights, obligations and any requirements
14
that must be met to qualify for the leave of absence, including statutory, job-protected leaves of absence under
applicable provincial employment standards legislation
B. PARENTAL LEAVE ‚ÄúTOP UP‚Äù
Dataiku takes great pride in its employees‚Äô well-being and fully supports its employees by enabling employees
to take unpaid time off and providing a top-up benefit (‚ÄúParental Leave Top Up‚Äù) during their statutory
pregnancy and parental leave to care for and bond with a new child following the birth of a child, adoption of
a child, or placement of a child in legal custody (each, a ‚ÄúQualifying Event‚Äù). The Parental Leave ‚ÄúTop Up‚Äù
policy applies to all Dataiku Canada employees in accordance with the eligibility criteria described in this
policy. Dataiku reserves the right to amend this policy at any time.
To be eligible for the Parental Leave ‚ÄúTop Up‚Äù, eligible employees must meet the following criteria:
‚óè Be a full-time employee; and
‚óè Experience a Qualifying Event.
If you qualify for benefit payment under the Employment Insurance (EI) or the Quebec Parental Insurance
Plan (QPIP), the Dataiku Parental Leave Top Up will run concurrently.. Dataiku will pay eligible employees
an amount equal to the difference between the employee‚Äôs weekly base salary and the employee‚Äôs EI or QPIP
payment up to a maximum of 100% of the employee‚Äôs weekly base salary for up to a maximum of twelve (12)
weeks.
Eligible employees may receive the Parental Leave Top Up at any time (consecutively or non-consecutively)
during the one (1) year period immediately following the Qualifying Event. There is no waiting priod
associated with the Dataiku Parental Leave Top Up. Any unused Parental Leave Top Up will be forfeited at
the end of the one (1) year period immediately following the Qualifying Event. Upon termination of
employment at Dataiku, eligible employees will not be paid for any unused Parental Leave time off or Top Up
benefit for which they may have been eligible, except as required by law.
Dataiku recommends that employees alert their regional People Operations team (people@dataiku.com) at
least two months before their expected departure in order to discuss the details related to their pregnancy and
parental leave.
We encourage you to plan ahead to ensure that we are able to take care of all of these items so that you can
take time with family and minimize any disruptions. As is the case with all Dataiku policies, Dataiku has the
exclusive right to revise or cancel the Parental Leave ‚ÄúTop Up‚Äù policy.

service de l'entreprise ¬ª.
‚ÄúLa dur√©e de cette intervention est consid√©r√©e comme un temps de travail effectif ¬ª
- Par ailleurs, l‚Äôaccord du 22 juin 1999 relatif √† la dur√©e du travail dans la branche Syntec dispose, en son
article 1
er
, que : ¬´ l'astreinte concerne les plages horaires en dehors des horaires habituels de travail pendant
lesquelles un salari√© peut √™tre amen√© √† intervenir √† la demande de l'employeur. Toute intervention effectu√©e
pendant la p√©riode d'astreinte, fait partie int√©grante du temps de travail effectif du salari√© ¬ª.
Ainsi, il ressort des dispositions l√©gales et conventionnelles qui pr√©c√®dent :
‚óè La p√©riode d'astreinte elle-m√™me : il s‚Äôagit de la p√©riode pendant laquelle le salari√©, sans √™tre sur son
lieu de travail et sans √™tre √† la disposition permanente et imm√©diate de son employeur, doit √™tre en
mesure d‚Äôintervenir pour accomplir un travail au service de l‚Äôentreprise.
‚óè Pendant les p√©riodes o√π il est d‚Äôastreinte, sous r√©serve de l‚Äôobligation pr√©cis√©e ci-dessus, le salari√©
demeure libre de vaquer √† des occupations personnelles de sorte que la p√©riode d‚Äôastreinte ne
constitue pas une p√©riode de travail effectif. Les p√©riodes d‚Äôastreinte constituent, √† l‚Äôexception des
p√©riodes d‚Äôintervention, des p√©riodes de repos au sens des articles L. 3131-1 et L. 3132-2 du code du
travail. Elle n‚Äôest donc pas r√©mun√©r√©e mais elle donne lieu √† compensation.
‚óè L‚Äôintervention pendant la p√©riode d'astreinte est une p√©riode de travail effectif et donne lieu √†
r√©mun√©ration dans les conditions pr√©vues par la pr√©sente d√©cision unilat√©rale.

3. Scope
3.1. Champ d‚Äôapplication
La pr√©sente d√©cision unilat√©rale s'applique √† tous les salari√©s de Dataiku, quelle que soit la nature de leur
contrat de travail, sans condition d'anciennet√© dont les comp√©tences sont en ad√©quation avec le besoin
d'astreinte concern√©.
Les modalit√©s d‚Äôam√©nagement des p√©riodes d‚Äôastreinte sont d√©finies et appliqu√©es en fonction des diff√©rentes
cat√©gories et affectations des salari√©s.
En tout √©tat de cause, sont express√©ment exclus du champ d‚Äôapplication de la pr√©sente d√©cision unilat√©rale les
mandataires sociaux et les cadres dirigeants tels que d√©finis √† l‚Äôarticle L. 3111-2 du Code du travail.
3.2. Recours √† l‚Äôastreinte
3.2.1. Certains services de la soci√©t√© Dataiku imposent d‚Äôassurer des astreintes.
Il s‚Äôagit des services suivants :
- L‚Äô√©quipe Site Reliability engineer
- L‚Äô√©quipe IT Support
3.2.2. Les diff√©rentes plages horaires d‚Äôastreintes sont d√©finies √† l‚Äôarticle 4 ci-dessous.
3.2.3. Les p√©riodes d‚Äôastreinte seront fix√©es en fonction des n√©cessit√©s de service.
Il est arr√™t√© que :
- En premier lieu, la soci√©t√© Dataiku entend privil√©gier la r√©alisation des astreintes sur la base du
volontariat et √† cette fin, il sera √©tabli dans chaque d√©partement de Dataiku susceptible d'√™tre concern√© par
les astreintes un tableau des volontaires ;
- En second lieu, √† d√©faut d‚Äôun nombre suffisant de salari√©s volontaires, les salari√©s ne pourront s‚Äôy opposer,
sauf √† faire valoir, et ce √† titre exceptionnel, des motifs imp√©rieux personnels et/ou familiaux ;
- En troisi√®me lieu, il ne pourra exister aucun droit acquis √† la pratique des astreintes pour les salari√©s
susceptibles d‚Äô√™tre d√©sign√©s, m√™me s‚Äôils sont r√©guli√®rement volontaires, que ce soit sur le principe ou le
volume des astreintes.
De plus, afin que soit assur√©e une rotation r√©guli√®re des salari√©s charg√©s d‚Äôassurer ces p√©riodes d‚Äôastreintes, la
soci√©t√© Dataiku :
- proc√©dera √† un arbitrage s‚Äôil existe plus de salari√©s volontaires que de besoins ;
- √† d√©faut de volontaires, d√©signera les salari√©s vis√©s par cette suj√©tion particuli√®re.
Cette information interviendra de fa√ßon individuelle par le biais du manager.

3.2.4. Le salari√© √† qui la Direction demande d‚Äôeffectuer un temps d‚Äôastreinte ne peut en refuser
l‚Äôex√©cution. Tout refus d‚Äôex√©cuter un temps d‚Äôastreinte ou toute soustraction √† un temps
d‚Äôastreinte devra √™tre justifi√© par un motif l√©gitime.
Un salari√© d‚Äôastreinte pourra se faire remplacer par l‚Äôun de ses coll√®gues concern√©s par le r√©gime d‚Äôastreinte, d√®s
lors qu‚Äôil aura pr√©alablement port√© ce changement √† la connaissance de son responsable hi√©rarchique au moins
48 heures avant la mise en ≈ìuvre effective de ce remplacement et que son responsable hi√©rarchique l‚Äôaura
express√©ment accept√©.
4. P√©riodes d'astreinte
Les p√©riodes et amplitude de l'astreinte sont les suivantes :
P√©riode Horaire de couverture de
l'astreinte
Nuits du lundi 18h au samedi 9h De 18h √† 9h
Samedis et dimanches Du samedi 9h au lundi 9h
Jours f√©ri√©s Du matin 9h au lendemain 9h
Une astreinte de week-end peut √™tre cons√©cutive √† une astreinte de semaine.
5. Planification
La programmation individuelle des p√©riodes d‚Äôastreinte rel√®ve de la seule comp√©tence de la Direction.
Chacun des responsables des d√©partements concern√©s, (ou leur rempla√ßant ou le N+1 en cas d'absence) :
‚óè √âtablira un planning mensuel d'astreinte par roulement et en concertation avec son √©quipe, de sorte
qu'une astreinte ne soit pas impos√©e au cours d'une semaine ou d'un week-end o√π le salari√© ne serait
pas en mesure de l'ex√©cuter, et en adressera copie au d√©partement People Ops et √† leur PBP le 15 de
chaque mois pour le mois suivant,
‚óè Communiquera √† chacun des salari√©s concern√©s son planning mensuel individuel d'astreinte 15 jours √†
l'avance, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles comme et en tout √©tat de cause au moins un jour franc √†
l'avance,
‚óè Communiquera au d√©partement People Ops et √† leur PBP les temps d‚Äôastreintes effectu√©s par le salari√©
√† r√©mun√©rer au plus tard le premier lundi du mois suivant.
6. Moyens mis √† disposition du service d'astreinte
Dataiku met notamment √† la disposition des salari√©s pendant les astreintes les moyens n√©cessaires √† leurs
interventions √† distance et leur permettant d‚Äôintervenir efficacement √† distance :
confidential www.dataiku.com 4
DocuSign Envelope ID: 8BC048DD-6FD9-45D0-8403-D7E39D71AC08
‚óè Un ordinateur professionnel leur permettant d‚Äôavoir acc√®s √† leur outil de travail √† distance ;
‚óè Tout mat√©riel n√©cessaire au t√©l√©travail d√©crit dans la charte t√©l√©travail.
Les moyens mis √† disposition sont susceptibles d'√©voluer.
Il est pr√©cis√© qu‚Äôen dehors de ce cadre, la mise √† disposition d‚Äôoutils de communication par l‚Äôemployeur
(t√©l√©phone, ordinateur, tablette‚Ä¶) au profit d‚Äôun salari√© ne signifie pas que ce dernier se trouve en p√©riode
d‚Äôastreinte. En effet, l‚Äôastreinte fait l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôune demande explicite de l‚Äôemployeur.
7. Obligations des salari√©s d'astreinte
Le salari√© d'astreinte sollicit√© doit :
‚óè Se tenir disponible et √™tre pr√™t √† intervenir en cas d‚Äôalerte
‚óè Demeurer √† son domicile ou dans un lieu disposant d‚Äôune bonne connexion internet pour pouvoir se
connecter aux outils n√©cessaires √† l‚Äôexercice de son travail et lui permettant d‚Äô√™tre joint en permanence
et d‚Äôintervenir rapidement.
‚óè Etre en mesure d‚Äôintervenir pour effectuer un travail pour l‚Äôentreprise
Toute intervention durant la p√©riode d'astreinte devra √™tre suivie par les outils utilis√©s dans le d√©partement,
Pagerduty, et le salari√© devra indiquer dans l‚Äôoutil en question la fin de son intervention.
La politique s√©curit√© de la soci√©t√© s‚Äôapplique dans le cadre de l‚Äôastreinte.
Chaque intervention r√©alis√©e par un salari√© fait l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôune d√©claration au moyen d‚Äôun rapport √©tabli √† cet effet
et fourni le lendemain au responsable hi√©rarchique et mentionnant :
- Date et l‚Äôheure de l‚Äôappel ;
- Cause de l‚Äôappel ;
- Description pr√©cise, horaire de d√©but et de fin et dur√©e de l‚Äôintervention ;
- R√©sultat obtenu.
Les rapports sont transmis par le responsable hi√©rarchique au service des ressources humaines le premier
lundu du mois suivant l‚Äôastreinte.
8. Comptabilisation de l'intervention pendant
l'astreinte
8.1. R√®gle de comptabilisation des interventions
Les r√®gles de comptabilisation du temps d'intervention durant la p√©riode d'astreinte sont les suivantes :
confidential www.dataiku.com 5
DocuSign Envelope ID: 8BC048DD-6FD9-45D0-8403-D7E39D71AC08
‚óè Le temps d'intervention (√† distance ou sur site) est consid√©r√© comme du travail effectif et d√©compt√©
comme tel
‚óè Le temps d'intervention est valoris√© sur la base du taux du salaire horaire fixe de base valoris√© comme
pr√©vu ci-dessous au point 8.2 et dans le respect de toute r√®gle de majoration pr√©vue par la loi et la
convention collective
8.2. M√©thode de valorisation de l'heure de travail
8.2.1. Pour les salari√©s d'astreinte dont le temps de travail est d√©compt√© en heures
Le salaire horaire est valoris√© comme suit : salaire mensuel brut fixe de base / 151,67 H.
Les p√©riodes d‚Äôintervention pourront, le cas √©ch√©ant, √™tre consid√©r√©es et trait√©es comme des heures
suppl√©mentaires si elles n‚Äôont pas √©t√© compens√©es au cours d‚Äôune m√™me semaine.
8.2.2. Pour les salari√©s d'astreinte dont le temps de travail est d√©compt√© en heure, selon la
modalit√© 2 (38H30/semaine sur 218 jours annuels)
En cas de d√©passement du forfait de 38h30, les conditions de la convention collective seront appliqu√©es.
Pour chaque tranche horaire de 3,5 heures de travail effectif, le salari√© d‚Äôastreinte recevra 0,5 jours de repos √†
prendre dans le mois suivant.
Les heures de travail effectif pendant les dimanches et jours f√©ri√©s compteront double.
Nombre d‚Äôheures de travail effectif Nombre de jours de repos
Entre 0 et 3,5 0,5
Entre 3,5 et 7 1
Entre 7 et 10,5 1,5
Exemple:
Un salari√© d‚Äôastreinte travaille 1,5 heures le vendredi de 22h √† 23h30. Il a travaill√© entre 0 et 3,5 heures, il re√ßoit
donc 0,5 jour de repos.
Un salari√© d‚Äôastreinte travaille 2 heures le dimanche de 9 √† 11h. Comme il a travaill√© un dimanche, on d√©compte 4
heures de travail effectif, il re√ßoit donc un jour de repos.
8.2.3. Pour les salari√©s d'astreinte dont le temps de travail est d√©compt√© en jours
Ces salari√©s soumis √† une convention de forfait en jours sur l‚Äôann√©e qui ne sont pas r√©mun√©r√©s sur la base d'un
d√©compte en heures, peuvent au m√™me titre que les autres salari√©s √™tre amen√©s √† √™tre d‚Äôastreinte. Il est rappel√©
que la r√©alisation d‚Äôastreintes par un salari√© soumis √† une convention de forfait en jours sur l‚Äôann√©e ne remet
pas en cause l‚Äôautonomie dont il dispose dans l‚Äôorganisation de son emploi du temps.
confidential www.dataiku.com 6
DocuSign Envelope ID: 8BC048DD-6FD9-45D0-8403-D7E39D71AC08
Il a √©t√© d√©cid√© de ne pas d√©compter les temps d‚Äôintervention dans le cadre du forfait jours annuel.
Pour les besoins exclusifs de l'application de la pr√©sente d√©cision unilat√©rale, les parties signataires sont donc
convenues de reconstituer la valeur de l'heure de travail sur la base suivante :
‚óè 12 mois civil,
‚óè 21,67 jours travaill√©s dans le mois,
‚óè 8 heures / jour
Selon la formule suivante :
1 heure = salaire annuel brut fixe de base /12/21,67/8
Exemple
Un salari√© d‚Äôastreinte per√ßoit une r√©mun√©ration brute annuelle de 40 K‚Ç¨.
Pour les besoins du pr√©sent Accord, l‚Äôheure de travail effectif est valoris√©e comme suit :
1 heure brute = 40 000 ‚Ç¨/12/21,67/8 = 19,22 ‚Ç¨ brut
9. Compensation financi√®re des p√©riodes d‚Äôastreinte
La p√©riode d‚Äôastreinte n‚Äôest pas une p√©riode de travail effectif et ne sera donc pas r√©mun√©r√©e en tant que telle.
Le salari√© d‚Äôastreinte percevra :
‚óè Une compensation financi√®re sous forme d‚Äôune prime d‚Äôastreinte forfaitaire au titre de la p√©riode
d‚Äôastreinte elle-m√™me, afin de prendre en compte la disponibilit√© des salari√©s concern√©s en dehors de
leur temps de travail ;
‚óè La r√©mun√©ration des interventions effectu√©es durant la p√©riode d‚Äôastreinte.
9.1. Prime d‚Äôastreinte
La prime d‚Äôastreinte est fix√©e comme suit selon les p√©riodes :
P√©riode d‚Äôastreintes Horaire maximum de
couverture de
l‚Äôastreinte
Prime d‚Äôastreinte
forfaitaire (brut)
Nuits du lundi 18h au
samedi
De 18h √† 9h 65 ‚Ç¨ brut par nuit
Samedis et dimanches Du samedi 9h au lundi

130 ‚Ç¨ brut par 24h
Jours f√©ri√©s Du matin 9h au
lendemain 9h

confidential www.dataiku.com 7
DocuSign Envelope ID: 8BC048DD-6FD9-45D0-8403-D7E39D71AC08
La Direction pourra revaloriser les montants ci-dessus √† chaque d√©but de trimestre.
Cette question sera soumise √† l‚Äôordre du jour de la r√©union mensuelle du CSE.
Cette indemnit√© forfaitaire est vers√©e avec le salaire du mois suivant la p√©riode d‚Äôastreinte r√©alis√©e sauf
impossibilit√© pratique tenant aux d√©lais de traitement de la paie pour le mois consid√©r√©.
9.2. Interventions durant la p√©riode d'astreinte
Les interventions durant l'astreinte seront compens√©es sur la base de l'heure de travail effectif comptabilis√©e
comme indiqu√© √† l'article 8.1, valoris√©e comme indiqu√© √† l'article 8.2.
Les contreparties li√©es aux p√©riodes d‚Äôintervention se cumulent avec l‚Äôindemnisation forfaitaire de la p√©riode
d‚Äôastreinte pr√©vue √† l‚Äôarticle 11.
10. Repos quotidien et hebdomadaire
Les parties signataires rappellent que :
‚óè Les salari√©s d'astreinte doivent b√©n√©ficier de l'int√©gralit√© des repos quotidiens et hebdomadaires.
‚óè La p√©riode d'astreinte elle-m√™me n'interrompt pas le d√©compte de la dur√©e des temps de repos
quotidien et hebdomadaire.
‚óè Seule l'intervention effective durant la p√©riode d'astreinte est susceptible d'interrompre la dur√©e du
repos quotidien et hebdomadaire. En cons√©quence, en cas d'intervention durant la p√©riode d'astreinte
susceptible d'interrompre la dur√©e du repos quotidien ou hebdomadaire, le repos int√©gral interrompu
doit √™tre pris par le salari√© d'astreinte √† compter de la fin de l'intervention, sauf si le salari√© a d√©j√†
b√©n√©fici√© avant le d√©but de son intervention, de l'int√©gralit√© de son repos quotidien ou hebdomadaire
(11h cons√©cutives pour le repos quotidien, 35h cons√©cutives pour le repos hebdomadaire).
Exemple 1 :
Un salari√© d'astreinte le week-end n'est pas intervenu. Ce salari√© d'astreinte a donc b√©n√©fici√© de l'int√©gralit√© de
son repos hebdomadaire.
Exemple 2 :
Un salari√© d'astreinte le week-end :
‚óè quitte son poste de travail le vendredi √† 18h
‚óè intervient le dimanche √† 23h, pendant 2h.
Ce salari√© d'astreinte a donc d√©j√† b√©n√©fici√© de l'int√©gralit√© de son repos hebdomadaire au d√©but de l‚Äôintervention.

DocuSign Envelope ID: 8BC048DD-6FD9-45D0-8403-D7E39D71AC08
Cependant, dans le cas o√π l'intervention faite au cours de l'astreinte r√©pond aux besoins de travaux urgents
dont l'ex√©cution imm√©diate est n√©cessaire pour organiser des mesures de sauvetage, pour pr√©venir des
accidents imminents ou r√©parer des accidents survenus au mat√©riel, aux installations ou aux b√¢timents de
l'√©tablissement dans le cadre d√©fini aux articles L. 3132-4 et D. 3131-5 du code du travail, le repos
hebdomadaire peut √™tre suspendu et il peut √™tre d√©rog√© au repos quotidien.
11. Contr√¥le ‚Äì Suivi
Le d√©partement des ressources humaines √©tablira mensuellement un √©tat r√©capitulatif du nombre d‚Äôheures
d‚Äôastreinte effectu√©es par chaque salari√© au cours du mois √©coul√© et la compensation correspondante. Ce
document mentionnera √©galement le nombre d‚Äôheures d‚Äôintervention accomplies au cours du mois √©coul√© et
les contreparties correspondantes.
Un exemplaire sera remis au salari√© avec son bulletin de paye, l'autre exemplaire sera conserv√© par le
d√©partement des ressources humaines pendant un an minimum.
12. Dur√©e et entr√©e en vigueur de la d√©cision
unilat√©rale
La pr√©sente d√©cision unilat√©rale de l‚Äôemployeur entrera en vigueur √† compter du 1
er
janvier 2023 et est institu√©e

1. Pr√©ambule
La pr√©sente proc√©dure de signalement s‚Äôinscrit dans le cadre de la mise en place d‚Äôun dispositif
de protection des lanceurs d‚Äôalerte pr√©vu par la loi n¬∞2016-1691 du 9 d√©cembre 2016 relative √†

¬ª, modifi√©e par les lois n¬∞2022-401 du 21 mars 2022, visant √† am√©liorer la protection des
lanceurs d‚Äôalerte.
Dans ce cadre, la soci√©t√© DATAIKU a d√©fini une proc√©dure de recueil et de traitement des alertes
professionnelles en interne applicable √† compter du 1er juin 2024, conform√©ment √† l‚Äôarticle 8
de la loi du 9 d√©cembre 2016 et les dispositions du d√©cret n¬∞2022-1284 du 3 octobre 2022

‚óè les cocontractants de la soci√©t√© DATAIKU, leurs sous-traitants ou, lorsqu‚Äôil s‚Äôagit de
personnes morales, les membres de l‚Äôorgane d‚Äôadministration, de direction ou de
surveillance de ces cocontractants et sous-traitants ainsi qu‚Äôaux membres de leur

4. Proc√©dure de signalement et destinataire de l‚Äôalerte
interne
Tout signalement doit respecter les conditions et modalit√©s expos√©es au sein de la pr√©sente
proc√©dure.
a. Modalit√©s de r√©ception des signalements
Un signalement peut √™tre effectu√©, par √©crit, de la mani√®re suivante :
o Le signalement peut √™tre effectu√© par le biais de la plateforme EthicsPoint
o Le signalement devra :
‚ñ™ Le cas √©ch√©ant, s‚Äôaccompagner de la transmission de tout √©l√©ment, quelle
que soit sa forme ou son support, de nature √† √©tayer le signalement de
faits qui se sont produits ou sont tr√®s susceptibles de se produire au sein
de la soci√©t√© DATAIKU. Les √©ventuels √©l√©ments communiqu√©s sont factuels
et pr√©sentent un lien direct avec l‚Äôobjet de l‚Äôalerte.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 4
‚ñ™ Contenir tout √©l√©ment permettant de justifier (i) de l‚Äôidentit√© de son auteur
et (ii) que celui-ci appartient √† l‚Äôune des cat√©gories de personnes
mentionn√©es √† l‚Äôarticle 2 de la pr√©sente proc√©dure.
D√®s r√©ception du signalement via la plateforme EthicsPoint, celui-ci sera automatiquement
transmis √† la personne la plus √† m√™me de le traiter.
Il est pr√©cis√© qu‚Äôen l‚Äôabsence d‚Äô√©l√©ment factuel et circonstanci√© suffisant permettant de traiter
utilement un signalement, a fortiori si celui-ci est op√©r√© de mani√®re anonyme, il sera difficile
voire impossible d‚Äôy donner une suite utile.
b. Traitement des signalements
Une fois que la personne a envoy√© le signalement, elle peut t√©l√©charger un compte rendu et
suivre l‚Äôavancement de sa demande en utilisant un code unique pour se connecter √† la
plateforme.
Sur la plateforme, la personne qui a envoy√© le signalement aura acc√®s √†:
- l‚Äô√©tat d‚Äôavancement de sa demande
- un r√©sum√© de son signalement
c. V√©rification de la conformit√© des signalements et
instructions
Une fois le signalement r√©ceptionn√©, la soci√©t√© DATAIKU s‚Äôattachera √† v√©rifier, sauf si le
signalement est anonyme, que les conditions relatives au signalement, notamment celles
indiqu√©es au sein des articles 1 et 2, sont r√©unies.
Lorsque le signalement est recevable, la soci√©t√© DATAIKU en assure l‚Äôinstruction au moyen d‚Äôune
enqu√™te interne.
Dans ce cadre, elle peut demander tout compl√©ment d‚Äôinformation √† l‚Äôauteur du signalement
afin d‚Äô√©valuer l‚Äôexactitude des all√©gations qui sont formul√©es.
Lorsque des mesures conservatoires sont n√©cessaires, notamment pour pr√©venir la destruction
de preuves relatives √† l‚Äôalerte, l‚Äôinformation de personnes vis√©es par l‚Äôalerte intervient apr√®s
l‚Äôadoption de ces mesures.
A l‚Äôissue de l‚Äôinstruction, deux hypoth√®ses sont susceptibles de se pr√©senter :
- les all√©gations li√©es au signalement paraissent av√©r√©es : la soci√©t√© DATAIKU met en
≈ìuvre les moyens √† sa disposition pour rem√©dier √† l‚Äôobjet du signalement et l‚Äôauteur en
est inform√© par √©crit ;
Confidential www.dataiku.com 5
- les all√©gations sont inexactes ou infond√©es ou le signalement est devenu ou est sans
objet : la soci√©t√© DATAIKU proc√®de √† la cl√¥ture du signalement et l‚Äôauteur du
signalement peut consulter le statut de son signalement sur la plateforme.
En tout √©tat de cause, et √† l‚Äôissue de l‚Äôenqu√™te, la soci√©t√© DATAIKU communique par √©crit √†
l‚Äôauteur du signalement, dans un d√©lai qui ne peut exc√©der trois mois √† compter de la r√©ception
du signalement ou, √† d√©faut d‚Äôaccus√© de r√©ception, trois mois √† compter de l‚Äôexpiration d‚Äôune
p√©riode de sept jours ouvr√©s suivant le signalement, des informations sur les mesures
envisag√©es ou prises pour √©valuer l‚Äôexactitude des all√©gations et, le cas √©ch√©ant, rem√©dier √†
l‚Äôobjet du signalement ainsi que sur les motifs de ces derni√®res.
d. Personnes habilit√©es pour recueillir et traiter les
signalements
Les personnes en charge de recueillir et traiter les signalements sont celles ayant acc√®s √† la
plateforme Ethicspoint.
Un tel acc√®s leur sera accord√© en ce qu‚Äôelles disposent, en raison de leur positionnement et
statut au sein de la Soci√©t√©, de la comp√©tence, de l‚Äôautorit√© et des moyens suffisants √† l‚Äôexercice
des missions mentionn√©es.
Les garanties permettant l‚Äôexercice impartial de ces missions sont les suivantes :
- La confidentialit√© stricte, sans que cela ne puisse emp√™cher ou compromettre la
v√©rification et le traitement des alertes,
- l‚Äôind√©pendance caract√©ris√©e par le fait que les personnes ayant acc√®s √† la plateforme
Ethicspoint ont un niveau hi√©rarchique √©lev√© et b√©n√©ficient d‚Äôune ind√©pendance dans
leurs fonctions et missions ;
- l‚Äôabsence de conflit d‚Äôint√©r√™ts, du fait que les personnes qui m√®neront l‚Äôenqu√™te ne
seront pas concern√©es, m√™me indirectement, par le signalement.
Dans l‚Äôhypoth√®se o√π les personnes qui m√®neront l‚Äôenqu√™te seraient concern√©es par le
signalement, une obligation de d√©port leur est impos√©e.
5. Protection du lanceur d‚Äôalerte
Le lanceur d‚Äôalerte ne peut faire l‚Äôobjet des mesures de repr√©sailles suivantes, en application des
articles L. 1121-2 du Code du travail et 10-1, II, de la loi n¬∞2016-1691 du 9 d√©cembre 2016 :

ainsi que les personnes physiques en lien avec un lanceur d‚Äôalerte et risquant de faire l‚Äôobjet de
repr√©sailles dans le cadre de leur activit√© professionnelle.
Le lanceur d'alerte b√©n√©ficie notamment, √† cet √©gard :
- d'un r√©gime de preuve am√©nag√© en cas de litige : d√®s lors que le lanceur d'alerte
pr√©sente des √©l√©ments de fait permettant de pr√©sumer qu'il a lanc√© son alerte de bonne
foi, il appartient √† l'entreprise de prouver que la d√©cision en cause est justifi√©e par des
√©l√©ments objectifs √©trangers au signalement.
- de la possibilit√© de saisir le conseil des prud'hommes en r√©f√©r√© en cas de rupture de son
contrat de travail cons√©cutive au signalement d'une alerte.

Ce r√®glement compl√®te les dispositions du contrat de travail de chacun des salari√©s et des
conventions et accords collectifs applicables au sein de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, tous les locaux et
sites de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS.
Des notes de service peuvent compl√©ter ou pr√©ciser les dispositions du pr√©sent r√®glement
int√©rieur ou ses modalit√©s d'application, notamment pour fixer des dispositions particuli√®res √†
certaines cat√©gories de salari√©s (ou √† certains secteurs, services ou sites).
Si elles portent prescriptions g√©n√©rales et permanentes en mati√®re de sant√© et de s√©curit√© dans
l‚Äôentreprise, ainsi qu‚Äôen mati√®re de discipline, ces notes de service re√ßoivent application, sous
r√©serve de respecter les formalit√©s de consultation des repr√©sentants du personnel, de d√©p√¥t et
de publicit√© pr√©vues par le Code du travail (article L. 1321-4), sauf si l'urgence justifie leur
application imm√©diate (article L. 1321-5 du Code du travail, second alin√©a).
Dans les autres cas, et notamment s'il s'agit simplement de pr√©ciser certaines modalit√©s
d'application du pr√©sent r√®glement int√©rieur ou de fixer des prescriptions n'ayant pas un
caract√®re g√©n√©ral et permanent, ces notes de service font l'objet d'un affichage ou d'une
communication particuli√®re, sans aucune restriction de quelque nature que ce soit. Elles
s'appliquent alors directement.
Les dispositions du pr√©sent r√®glement int√©rieur ne sauraient faire obstacle √† l‚Äôapplication des
textes l√©gaux et conventionnels.
1.2- Champ d‚Äôapplication
Les r√®gles du pr√©sent r√®glement int√©rieur concernant notamment l‚Äôhygi√®ne et la s√©curit√©, la
discipline et la protection des personnes et des biens ont vocation √† favoriser un climat de
confiance et de compr√©hension r√©ciproques, propice √† l'am√©lioration des relations humaines et
au d√©veloppement de la participation individuelle √† la vie d‚Äôentreprise.
Elles ne peuvent √™tre pleinement efficaces que si elles re√ßoivent l'adh√©sion pleine et enti√®re
ainsi que la participation active de tout le personnel de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS sur l'ensemble de
ses sites.
Le r√®glement s'applique ainsi √† tous les membres du personnel de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, mais
√©galement √† tout visiteur, stagiaire, int√©rimaire ou collaborateur d'entreprises ou d'organismes
ext√©rieurs, ainsi qu'√† toute autre personne pr√©sente dans les locaux de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS,
pour les dispositions qui les concernent (√† l‚Äôexception des dispositions relatives √† l‚Äô√©chelle des
sanctions et au pouvoir disciplinaire).
En outre, il s'applique √† l‚Äôensemble des locaux de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS : bureaux, locaux
communs, annexes et, le cas √©ch√©ant, d√©pendances ext√©rieures aux b√¢timents.
En cas d'activit√© exerc√©e sur mandat hors des locaux de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, le personnel
concern√© devra √©galement respecter les r√®gles d'hygi√®ne et de s√©curit√© applicables sur ce lieu

DISPOSITIONS RELATIVES √Ä L'HYGIENE ET
A LA SECURITE
En adoptant des r√®gles relatives √† l‚Äôhygi√®ne et √† la s√©curit√©, la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS entend avant
tout assurer la protection des personnes composant ses √©quipes ou collaborant avec elles dont
la vie, la sant√© physique et psychique doit √™tre sauvegard√©e.
Chacun au sein de l'entreprise doit s'y conformer pour soi-m√™me et pour les autres.
Les mesures d'hygi√®ne et de s√©curit√© sont √©dict√©es conform√©ment aux dispositions l√©gales et
r√©glementaires en vigueur, ainsi qu'aux prescriptions de la m√©decine du travail et de l'inspection
du travail.
S'agissant de mesures pr√©ventives, elles doivent √™tre appliqu√©es avec rigueur.
Par cons√©quent, le refus de se soumettre aux prescriptions relatives √† la s√©curit√© et √† l‚Äôhygi√®ne,
et notamment √† celles pr√©vues par le pr√©sent r√®glement int√©rieur, est susceptible d'entra√Æner
l'engagement d'une proc√©dure disciplinaire.
2.1 - Surveillance m√©dicale
Afin que la sant√© et l'int√©grit√© physique de chaque salari√© soient suivies et pr√©serv√©es d√®s
l'embauche et tout au long de sa relation de travail avec la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, chacun doit se
soumettre ‚Äì en fonction de sa situation personnelle ‚Äì aux examens m√©dicaux pr√©vus aux
articles R. 4624-10 et suivants du Code du travail ; visite d‚Äôinformation et de pr√©vention, visite
p√©riodique, visite de reprise du travail, examens compl√©mentaires demand√©s par le m√©decin du
travail ou au titre de la surveillance m√©dicale renforc√©e, etc.
Pour une bonne organisation de cette surveillance m√©dicale, qui est mise en ≈ìuvre au profit de
l'ensemble de la communaut√© de travail, chaque membre du personnel doit se pr√©senter aux
visites m√©dicales aux dates et heures de convocation.
En raison de leur caract√®re obligatoire, les visites m√©dicales sont consid√©r√©es comme du temps
de travail effectif et le refus de s'y soumettre est susceptible d'entra√Æner l'engagement d'une
proc√©dure disciplinaire.
2.2 - S√©curit√© et Pr√©vention des accidents
La pr√©vention des risques, accidents et maladies professionnelles, concerne l‚Äôensemble des
personnes vis√©es dans l‚Äôarticle 1.2.
Elle vise √† ce que le d√©veloppement de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS se r√©alise dans les meilleures
conditions de s√©curit√© et de protection des hommes et de l'outil de travail. Elle est donc
imp√©rative.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 4
DocuSign Envelope ID: AE032083-34A2-4FC7-975A-B44BCD04CB05
Elle exige en particulier de chacun le respect de toutes les prescriptions applicables en mati√®re
d‚Äôhygi√®ne et de s√©curit√©.
Les salari√©s ont, en tout √©tat de cause, l‚Äôobligation de respecter toutes les consignes
particuli√®res qui leur sont donn√©es par le personnel d‚Äôencadrement pour l‚Äôex√©cution de leur
travail et, notamment, les consignes de s√©curit√© sp√©cifiques √† cette ex√©cution.
Le personnel devra se conformer √† toute autre exigence selon les besoins et les directives en
mati√®re de s√©curit√©.
Selon l‚Äôarticle L. 4122-I, 1¬∞ du Code du Travail, il incombe de mani√®re g√©n√©rale √† chaque salari√©
de prendre soin de sa s√©curit√© et de sa sant√©, mais aussi, en fonction de sa formation et selon
ses possibilit√©s, de celles des autres personnes qui pourraient √™tre concern√©es du fait de ses
actes ou de ses omissions au travail.
La d√©t√©rioration ou le mauvais fonctionnement des dispositifs de s√©curit√© dont le personnel
aurait connaissance doit en outre √™tre imp√©rativement signal√© √† la Direction.
Toute intervention sur les dispositifs de s√©curit√©, notamment pour leur neutralisation, est
strictement interdite, sauf op√©rations d‚Äôentretien ou de r√©paration par les personnes autoris√©es.
Chacun doit √™tre conscient des risques qui peuvent exister au niveau de son activit√© et des
moyens pour √©viter leur survenance. Lorsque des actions de formation, de pr√©vention et
d‚Äôinformation relatives √† la pr√©vention des situations dangereuses sont mises en place au sein
de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, les salari√©s dont la pr√©sence est pr√©vue sont tenus d‚Äôy participer.
Tout refus de se conformer aux consignes qui pr√©c√®dent est susceptible d'entra√Æner
l'engagement d'une proc√©dure disciplinaire.
2.3 - Utilisation du mat√©riel de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS
Chaque membre du personnel est tenu d‚Äôutiliser le mat√©riel qui lui est confi√© conform√©ment √†
son objet et dans des conditions normales de s√©curit√©.
L‚Äôutilisateur est responsable de l‚Äôusage qu‚Äôil fait du mat√©riel qui lui est mis √† sa disposition par la
soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS.
L‚Äôutilisation, pour des besoins personnels, du mat√©riel appartenant √† l‚Äôentreprise ne doit pas
engendrer d‚Äôinfraction √† la loi, aux r√®glements, aux bonnes m≈ìurs ou d‚Äôatteinte √† la vie priv√©e.
Il est interdit d‚Äôemporter, en dehors des locaux de l‚Äôentreprise, le mat√©riel appartenant √† la
soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, sauf autorisation expresse de la hi√©rarchie, √† l‚Äôexception du mat√©riel
n√©cessaire √† l‚Äôexercice des missions du collaborateur en t√©l√©travail (t√©l√©phone, ordinateur,
chargeur, souris, clavier, etc.)
Tout usage abusif du mat√©riel mis √† sa disposition, qui serait notamment contraire √† un
comportement diligent, pourrait √™tre sanctionn√©.
L‚Äôutilisation, au sein de la soci√©t√©, de mat√©riels personnels, notamment √©lectriques et/ou
√©lectroniques, qui pr√©senteraient un risque en termes de sant√© et/ou de s√©curit√©, telles que
Confidential www.dataiku.com 5
DocuSign Envelope ID: AE032083-34A2-4FC7-975A-B44BCD04CB05
bouilloire √©lectrique, cafeti√®re, micro-ondes, est subordonn√©e √† autorisation pr√©alable et
expresse de la Direction (ou de l‚Äôun de ses repr√©sentants), √† l‚Äôexception des mat√©riels mis √†
disposition des salari√©s par la soci√©t√©, dans les bureaux.
En r√®gle g√©n√©rale, tout salari√© est tenu de conserver en bon √©tat le mat√©riel qui lui est confi√©
pour l'ex√©cution de son travail et doit s'assurer en toutes circonstances qu'il est utilis√©, conserv√©
et entretenu conform√©ment aux notices techniques l'accompagnant et aux consignes
particuli√®res donn√©es.
Cependant l‚Äôentretien m√©canique et/ou de s√©curit√© desdits mat√©riels reste √† la charge de
l‚Äôemployeur.
Les appareils √©lectriques (√©clairage d‚Äôappoint et/ou collectif, mat√©riel informatique, hi-fi, vid√©o,
etc.) devront √™tre √©teints d√®s la cessation de l‚Äôactivit√©, sauf op√©rations d‚Äôentretien ou de
r√©paration par les personnes autoris√©es.
Toute intervention sur du mat√©riel appartenant √† la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, soit par un membre du
personnel d'ex√©cution, soit par une personne sp√©cialis√©e, est soumise aux consignes
particuli√®res donn√©es √† cet effet.
Le mat√©riel ne doit pas √™tre mis en marche ou utilis√© tant que les dispositifs de s√©curit√© sont
neutralis√©s, sauf en cas d‚Äôop√©rations de r√©glage, d‚Äôentretien ou de r√©paration qui seront
effectu√©es par le personnel habilit√© et sur ordre du responsable qui veillera au bon d√©roulement
des travaux afin de pr√©venir tout accident.
Toute d√©faillance, arr√™t de fonctionnement ou anomalie d'entretien des appareils ou
installations et, en g√©n√©ral, tout incident technique doit √™tre imm√©diatement signal√© au
sup√©rieur hi√©rarchique.
A son d√©part effectif de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, pour quelque cause que ce soit, tout salari√© doit
spontan√©ment et sans d√©lai restituer l'ensemble des mat√©riels et documents mis √† sa
disposition pour l'ex√©cution de ses fonctions.
2.4 - Situation dangereuse ‚Äì Droit de retrait
La soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS encourage ses salari√©s √† d√©velopper un esprit d'observation et des
r√©flexes d'intervention face aux situations dangereuses.
Conform√©ment aux dispositions des articles L. 4131-1 et suivants du Code du travail, tout salari√©
ayant un motif raisonnable de penser que sa situation de travail pr√©sente un danger grave et
imminent pour sa vie ou sa sant√© doit en avertir imm√©diatement son sup√©rieur hi√©rarchique
direct ou, le cas √©ch√©ant, un autre responsable de l'entreprise qui devra en r√©f√©rer aussit√¥t √† la
Direction.
Dans ces conditions, le salari√© peut exercer son droit de retrait de son poste de travail.
Le salari√© devra donner toutes les informations concernant le danger consid√©r√© par lui comme
grave et imminent. Le salari√© sera en mesure de relater la situation dans un document √©crit et
sign√©.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 6
DocuSign Envelope ID: AE032083-34A2-4FC7-975A-B44BCD04CB05
Cependant, cette facult√© de se retirer d‚Äôune situation dangereuse doit √™tre exerc√©e de telle
mani√®re qu‚Äôelle ne puisse cr√©er pour autrui une nouvelle situation de risque grave imminent, en
aval ou en amont de sa propre activit√©.
Aucune sanction ne pourra √™tre prise √† l'encontre d'un salari√© ou d'un groupe de salari√©s qui se
serait retir√© d'une situation de travail telle que celle vis√©e ci-dessus et ayant pris les mesures de
pr√©caution n√©cessaires pour que le risque ne rejaillisse pas sur d'autres salari√©s.
Dans l'attente du r√©sultat de l'enqu√™te men√©e par la Direction ou par tout personnel
sp√©cialement d√©l√©gu√© par cette derni√®re √† cet effet pour d√©terminer si la situation pr√©sentait un
risque grave et imminent, toutes les mesures n√©cessaires pour assurer la s√©curit√© des salari√©s
seront prises.
2.5 - Principe de neutralit√©
L‚Äôentreprise est attach√©e au respect des libert√©s individuelles, et en particulier les libert√©s
fondamentales au titre desquelles toute personne a droit √† la libert√© de penser, de conscience
et de religion et est libre de ses croyances en son for int√©rieur.
Pour autant, il est rappel√© que la sph√®re de l‚Äôentreprise doit demeurer un espace de neutralit√©
au sein duquel les opinions et croyances personnelles ne doivent pas influencer, interf√©rer ou
troubler le travail de la communaut√© du personnel, dont les membres peuvent ne pas partager
les m√™mes opinions ou croyances quelles qu‚Äôelles soient.
Le principe de neutralit√© affirm√© dans le pr√©sent r√®glement int√©rieur vise √† conforter la
confiance que peuvent avoir les salari√©s, les partenaires, et les clients de l‚Äôentreprise dans le
fonctionnement et le service rendu par celle-ci. Il est fondamental notamment qu‚Äôaucune
connotation politique ou religieuse ne vienne interf√©rer ou troubler la relation de travail √†
l‚Äô√©gard d‚Äôune client√®le elle-m√™me diversifi√©e.
D√®s lors, et sans pr√©tendre √† un principe g√©n√©ral d‚Äôinterdiction de tous signes religieux,
politiques ou d‚Äôopinion, il est attendu de toute personne soumise au pr√©sent r√®glement
int√©rieur qu‚Äôelle s‚Äôabstienne, lorsqu‚Äôelle est en contact avec la client√®le (notamment et en
particulier les salari√©s commerciaux de l‚Äôentreprise), de manifester de mani√®re visible, ses
opinions politiques et/ou religieuses, notamment au travers de signes et/ou tenues
vestimentaires ou par tout autre moyen, quel qu‚Äôen soit le lieu (bureaux, salles de r√©unions,
accueil, visioconf√©rence, etc.).
Par ailleurs, tout acte de pros√©lytisme ou d‚Äôendoctrinement, dans l‚Äôensemble des locaux de
l‚Äôentreprise (locaux de travail, vestiaires, couloirs, salles de repos, etc.) est interdit.
2. 6 - Accidents
Sauf cas de force majeure ou impossibilit√© absolue, tout accident, m√™me l√©ger, ou urgence
m√©dicale survenu soit pendant le trajet entre le lieu de travail et le domicile, soit au cours du
travail, devra √™tre port√© √† la connaissance du sup√©rieur hi√©rarchique et du service en charge de
la gestion des ressources humaines par le salari√© concern√© ou par un t√©moin.

DocuSign Envelope ID: AE032083-34A2-4FC7-975A-B44BCD04CB05
En cas d'accident ou de maladie entra√Ænant un arr√™t de travail, le salari√© doit, d√®s que possible,
et en tout √©tat de cause dans les trois jours suivant l'arr√™t de travail, communiquer au service en
charge de la gestion des ressources humaines le volet destin√© √† l‚Äôemployeur du ou des
certificats m√©dicaux relatifs √† l'accident ou √† la maladie, y compris en cas de rechute.
Le personnel doit respecter les consignes de s√©curit√© en cas d'accident survenant dans les
locaux de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS et, le cas √©ch√©ant, pr√©venir le service en charge de la gestion
des ressources humaines pour faciliter et acc√©l√©rer la r√©ception des secours si ceux-ci ont √©t√©
appel√©s.
2.7 - Incendie ‚Äì Urgence M√©dicale
Les Sapeurs Pompiers peuvent √™tre contact√©s par t√©l√©phone aux num√©ros suivants :
- depuis un poste fixe : 18
- depuis un t√©l√©phone mobile : 112
Les consignes de s√©curit√© en cas d'incendie sont clairement affich√©es dans les locaux, √† chaque
√©tage le cas √©ch√©ant et √† proximit√© imm√©diate de toute porte coupe-feu.
Les membres du personnel sont tenus d'en prendre connaissance, de les respecter et de veiller
au libre acc√®s aux moyens mat√©riels de lutte contre ce sinistre (lances, extincteurs, etc.), ainsi
qu'aux issues de secours.
La Direction s'assurera du respect de la r√©glementation √† cet √©gard notamment sur les points
suivants :
- v√©rification de la conformit√© des locaux (issues de secours, espaces de d√©gagement dans
les couloirs),
- v√©rification du bon √©tat du mat√©riel √† utiliser en cas d'urgence (emplacement et bon √©tat
de fonctionnement des extincteurs, etc.),
- d√©signation d'un responsable, √† chaque √©tage le cas √©ch√©ant, pour assurer l'√©vacuation
du personnel dans les meilleures conditions.
Un exercice d'√©vacuation sera organis√© au moins une fois par an, sans pr√©avis. L'ensemble du
personnel est tenu d'y participer, sous peine de sanction.

2.8 - Boissons et repas sur les lieux de travail
2.8.1. La consommation d‚Äôalcool est g√©n√©ratrice d‚Äôamplification des risques individuels et
collectifs.
Afin de prot√©ger la sant√© physique et mentale, la s√©curit√© de l'ensemble de son personnel et de
pr√©venir le risque d‚Äôaccident, la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS interdit l'introduction, la consommation et
la distribution de boissons alcoolis√©es dans les locaux de travail dans le cadre des dispositions
l√©gales en vigueur (article R. 4228-20 du Code du travail).
A titre exceptionnel et dans les conditions limitativement pr√©vues ci-apr√®s, la Direction pourra
introduire ou laisser introduire des boissons alcoolis√©es autres que celles pr√©vues par l‚Äôarticle R.
4228-20 du Code du travail, dans les locaux de travail √† l‚Äôoccasion de ¬´ pot ¬ª qu‚Äôelle d√©cide
d‚Äôorganiser ou qu‚Äôelle autorise exceptionnellement.
Il appartient alors au repr√©sentant de la Direction organisant l‚Äô√©v√©nement ou en charge de
surveiller l‚Äôorganisation de l‚Äô√©v√©nement de d√©cider d‚Äôautoriser le service de boissons alcoolis√©es,
d‚Äôen d√©finir le degr√© maximum d‚Äôalcool (par exemple vin et/ou cidre et/ou champagne dont le
degr√© d‚Äôalcool est au maximum de 13 degr√©s), √† l‚Äôexception de tous autres alcools.
La soci√©t√© DATAIKU SAS tient √† rappeler √† chaque membre du personnel que chacun doit rester
responsable de ses agissements et doit en cons√©quence adopter un comportement raisonnable
et d√©cent, dans les locaux de la soci√©t√©, en toutes circonstances.
Il appartiendra ainsi √† chaque salari√© de veiller, en toute circonstance, √† la s√©curit√© des biens et
des personnes.
En tout √©tat de cause, et √† tout moment, il est interdit de p√©n√©trer ou de demeurer dans
l'entreprise en √©tat d'√©bri√©t√©.
2.8.2. Le personnel dispose d‚Äôun local de restauration mis √† sa disposition comprenant les
√©quipements suivants :
- des si√®ges et tables en nombre suffisant ;
- un robinet d'eau potable, fra√Æche et chaude ;
- trois r√©frig√©rateurs pour la conservation des aliments et des boissons ;
- trois installations permettant de r√©chauffer les plats.

2.9 - D√©pistage de l‚Äôalcool√©mie
En raison de l‚Äôobligation faite au chef d‚Äôentreprise d‚Äôassurer la s√©curit√© des personnes et des
biens dans l‚Äôentreprise ou chez ses clients, la Direction pourra √©galement imposer, en cas de
pr√©somption d‚Äôivresse, l‚Äôalcootest aux personnes occup√©es, le cas √©ch√©ant :
- √† l‚Äôex√©cution de certains travaux ;
- √† la conduite de certains engins, machines ou v√©hicules automobiles que ce soit
professionnel ou personnel ;
- √† la manipulation de produits dangereux ;
et ce, dans les cas o√π l‚Äô√©tat d‚Äôimpr√©gnation alcoolique pr√©sum√© constituerait un danger ou une
menace pour eux-m√™mes ou pour leur entourage.
Lors de ces contr√¥les, la personne concern√©e pourra, si elle en √©met le souhait, b√©n√©ficier de la
pr√©sence d‚Äôun tiers.
Le refus de l‚Äôint√©ress√©, de se soumettre √† un contr√¥le d'alcool√©mie, autorise la soci√©t√© DATAIKU
√† prendre toute mesure n√©cessaire √† la sauvegarde de la s√©curit√© de son personnel.
2.10 - Consommation de produits psychotropes et de
stup√©fiants
Il est rappel√© √† l'ensemble du personnel que l‚Äôintroduction, la consommation et la distribution
de produits psychotropes et de stup√©fiants de quelque nature que ce soit sont strictement
interdites au sein de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS et dans le cadre de toute mission √† son service.
Tout manquement sur ce point constitue une faute grave.
2.11 - Interdiction de fumer
En application du D√©cret n¬∞2006-1386 du 15 novembre 2006, il est interdit de fumer (toutes
formes de cigarettes ou cigarettes √©lectroniques et tout ce qui s‚Äôen rapproche, cigare, pipe,
etc‚Ä¶) dans tous les lieux de travail ferm√©s et couverts et dans les locaux affect√©s √† l'ensemble
des salari√©s, tels que salles de r√©union, de restauration, de repos, d'accueil et de r√©ception ainsi
que dans les bureaux individuels ou collectifs, et y compris dans les aires de stockage, escaliers
et parkings.
Pour des raisons de s√©curit√©, les lieux ouverts et d√©couverts situ√©s dans l'enceinte d'un
√©tablissement de la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS et d√©clar√©s comme √©tant non-fumeurs par affichage
sont √©galement concern√©s par cette interdiction.
L'interdiction ne s'applique pas aux locaux ou emplacements qui, apr√®s consultation des
repr√©sentants du personnel, peuvent √™tre mis √† la disposition des salari√©s fumeurs.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 10
DocuSign Envelope ID: AE032083-34A2-4FC7-975A-B44BCD04CB05
Compte tenu de l‚Äôimage que souhaite v√©hiculer la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS, les salari√©s fumeurs
veilleront √† ne pas stationner devant les portes d‚Äôentr√©e des lieux de travail ou d‚Äôaccueil du
public et jeter ses m√©gots que ce soit sur les trottoirs et/ou dans les jardins de la soci√©t√©.
En vertu du principe de pr√©caution, cette interdiction s‚Äôapplique de la m√™me mani√®re aux
cigarettes √©lectroniques, appel√©es √©galement e-cigarettes, dans la mesure o√π l‚Äô√©tat des
connaissances scientifiques, telles que r√©pertori√©es notamment par l‚ÄôINRS ne permet pas
d‚Äô√©carter tout risque pour la sant√©, pour les personnes qui les utilisent et pour leur entourage.
D'une fa√ßon g√©n√©rale, la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS compte sur chacun pour adopter un
comportement responsable en la mati√®re.
2.12 - Propret√© des locaux
D'une mani√®re g√©n√©rale, les locaux, toilettes, cuisine, frigidaire, micro-ondes, et le mat√©riel mis
√† la disposition des salari√©s doivent √™tre maintenus en parfait √©tat de propret√©, et plus
particuli√®rement les locaux accueillant la client√®le.
Le personnel doit utiliser les poubelles et corbeilles mises √† sa disposition √† cet effet. Il doit
veiller √† ce qu‚Äôaucun produit ou √©l√©ment jet√© dans une poubelle ne soit susceptible de causer
un d√©g√¢t, notamment en cas de risque d‚Äôinflammation.
Afin de faciliter les d√©placements, ainsi que l‚Äô√©vacuation √©ventuelle des locaux en cas d‚Äôincendie
ou d‚Äôautre sinistre, le personnel veillera √† ce que les all√©es ne soient pas encombr√©es et restent
libres de circulation.
2.13 - Casiers individuels / Contr√¥les
Les casiers individuels sont mis √† la disposition des salari√©s pour qu‚Äôils y d√©posent leurs effets
personnels √† l‚Äôexclusion de tout autre endroit. Ils doivent √™tre verrouill√©s et ne doivent √™tre
utilis√©s qu'au stockage d‚Äôeffets personnels (et non de denr√©es alimentaires notamment).
Les casiers doivent √™tre maintenus dans un √©tat constant de propret√© et √™tre vid√©s au moins une
fois par an, pour √™tre nettoy√©s.
La Direction se r√©serve le droit de faire ouvrir √† tout moment les casiers en pr√©sence des
salari√©s occupants afin d‚Äôen contr√¥ler l‚Äô√©tat et les faire d√©sinfecter lorsque cela est n√©cessaire.
En cas de disparition d‚Äôobjets, de mat√©riels ou de documents de l‚Äôentreprise, et dans l‚Äôint√©r√™t de
la s√©curit√© collective du personnel, des fouilles de casiers pourront √™tre organis√©es, apr√®s en
avoir inform√© les salari√©s concern√©s.
L‚Äôouverture des casiers se fera en pr√©sence des int√©ress√©s qui devront en toutes circonstances
en √™tre avertis et avec leur accord, sauf en cas d‚Äôurgence pour des raisons notamment li√©es √†
l‚Äôhygi√®ne et √† la protection contre l‚Äôincendie, en pr√©sence d‚Äôun repr√©sentant du personnel.
Les clefs des casiers restent en possession des salari√©s. Elles devront toutefois √™tre remises au
service en charge de la gestion des ressources humaines lorsque le salari√© quittera
d√©finitivement la soci√©t√© Dataiku SAS.

esp√®ces ou objets de toute nature d√©pos√©s dans un endroit quelconque, clos ou non clos et

Si les circonstances le justifient, notamment en cas de disparition d'objets ou de mat√©riels, la
Direction se r√©serve le droit de proc√©der, lors des entr√©es et sorties du personnel, √† la
v√©rification des objets transport√©s, ceci en pr√©sence de tiers, salari√©s ou repr√©sentants du
personnel.
En pareil cas, les salari√©s sont invit√©s √† pr√©senter le contenu de leurs effets ou objets
personnels, √©tant pr√©cis√© qu'ils peuvent refuser cette v√©rification et que les services de la Police
Nationale ou de la Gendarmerie peuvent alors √™tre alert√©s.

Toute modification des horaires s'impose au personnel concern√©, y compris si elle entra√Æne
l'ex√©cution d'heures suppl√©mentaires.
La dur√©e du travail s'entendant du travail effectif au sens de l'article L. 3121-1 du Code du travail
(¬´ La dur√©e du travail effectif est le temps pendant lequel le salari√© est √† la disposition de

l'une des dispositions du r√®glement int√©rieur et plus g√©n√©ralement tout agissement d'un salari√©
consid√©r√© comme fautif pourra, en fonction de la gravit√© des fautes et/ou de leur r√©p√©tition,
faire l'objet de l'une ou l'autre des sanctions class√©es ci-apr√®s par ordre d'importance. Aucune
sanction p√©cuniaire (amendes et autres retenues sur salaires) ne pourra √™tre prononc√©e.
3.9.2 - Nature et √©chelle des sanctions

du salari√© dans l'entreprise, sa fonction, sa carri√®re ou sa r√©mun√©ration.
Confidential www.dataiku.com 17
DocuSign Envelope ID: AE032083-34A2-4FC7-975A-B44BCD04CB05

La mise √† pied constitue une exclusion temporaire de l'entreprise de 5 jours ouvr√©s au

La mutation ou la r√©trogradation consiste en un changement de poste √† titre temporaire
ou d√©finitif, pouvant ou non affecter la classification, voire la r√©mun√©ration du salari√© en

- Licenciement pour faute
Une faute simple peut entra√Æner la rupture du contrat de travail, sous r√©serve du droit √†
un pr√©avis, ex√©cut√© ou non, pay√© et du versement d'une indemnit√© de licenciement,
lorsque les conditions pour son octroi sont r√©unies.
- Licenciement pour faute grave
La faute grave entra√Æne la rupture du contrat de travail sans pr√©avis ni indemnit√© de
licenciement.
- Licenciement pour faute lourde
La faute lourde prive le salari√©, non seulement du pr√©avis et de l'indemnit√© de
licenciement, mais √©galement de l'indemnit√© compensatrice de cong√©s pay√©s acquise √†
la date de la rupture du contrat de travail.
Pour les licenciements comportant une p√©riode de pr√©avis, ce dernier peut √™tre interrompu de
fa√ßon anticip√©e en cas de d√©couverte pendant ledit pr√©avis d'une faute grave ou lourde qui ne
fasse pas d√©j√† l'objet de la sanction notifi√©e.

Aucune sanction ne peut √™tre inflig√©e au salari√©, sans qu'il ne soit inform√© dans le m√™me temps
et par √©crit des griefs retenus contre lui.
A l‚Äôexception de l‚Äôavertissement et du bl√¢me, qui ne font l‚Äôobjet que d‚Äôune notification √©crite,
toute autre sanction prise par l‚Äôemployeur de nature √† affecter imm√©diatement ou non la
pr√©sence du salari√© dans l‚Äôentreprise, sa fonction, sa carri√®re ou sa r√©mun√©ration sera soumise √†

Cette notification indique les motifs de la sanction.
3.10.4 - Mise √† pied conservatoire
En cas d'urgence, si les agissements du salari√© rendent indispensable une mesure conservatoire
de mise √† pied avec effet imm√©diat, le respect de la proc√©dure disciplinaire n'est pas exig√© et le
salari√© doit s'y conformer imm√©diatement.
Confirmation de cette mesure lui est parall√®lement faite par √©crit en m√™me temps que la
convocation √† l'entretien dans les formes pr√©vues par l'article 4.10. ci-dessus.
La mesure conservatoire de mise √† pied porte effet jusqu'√† la notification de la sanction
d√©finitive, √† moins qu'en fonction des circonstances une dur√©e de mise √† pied plus br√®ve ait √©t√©
appliqu√©e et confirm√©e au salari√©.
Si la sanction prise en d√©finitive est une mise √† pied disciplinaire, elle peut se confondre en tout
ou partie avec celle notifi√©e √† titre conservatoire.

POLITIQUE INTERNE CONFIDENTIELLE DE DATAIKU - NE PAS PARTAGER
Date d‚Äôentr√©e en vigueur : 5 mars 2024
INTRODUCTION
Dataiku estime qu‚Äôune identit√© diversifi√©e est une source de force et nous permet d‚Äôoptimiser
les nombreuses dimensions n√©cessaires √† notre r√©ussite.
Chez Dataiku, nous voulons que tous nos employ√©s se sentent valoris√©s, respect√©s et
encourag√©s √† partager des perspectives diff√©rentes afin que les gens puissent se sentir libres
d‚Äô√™tre qui ils sont au travail.
√Ä cette fin, Dataiku s‚Äôengage √† fournir √† ses employ√©s un environnement de travail
professionnel respectueux et inclusif, exempt de harc√®lement, de discrimination, d‚Äôintimidation,
de violence et de repr√©sailles.
APPLICATION DE LA POLITIQUE
Nous partageons tous la responsabilit√© de faire respecter un lieu de travail respectueux et
inclusif. Cette politique s‚Äôapplique globalement √† tous les employ√©s de Dataiku sans exception,
ainsi qu‚Äôaux clients, fournisseurs, entrepreneurs, autres travailleurs occasionnels ou
non-employ√©s qui font affaire avec l‚Äôentreprise.
Les actions interdites par cette politique sont inacceptables sur le lieu de travail et dans tout
cadre li√© au travail en dehors du lieu de travail. Cela inclut tout cadre physique ou virtuel o√π
des affaires au nom de Dataiku sont effectu√©es, y compris le ou les lieux de travail d‚Äôun
employ√© (y compris les bureaux d‚Äôaffaires ou √† domicile), divers canaux de communication, y
compris les e-mails, Slack, les plateformes de vid√©oconf√©rence, les m√©dias sociaux, les
r√©unions en personne et toute fonction li√©e au travail (y compris les conf√©rences, les
s√©minaires, les voyages d‚Äôaffaires et les √©v√©nements sociaux li√©s √† l‚Äôentreprise √† l‚Äôint√©rieur ou
√† l‚Äôext√©rieur du bureau).
POLITIQUE
Tous les employ√©s et personnes concern√©es sont cens√©s contribuer √† un lieu de travail
respectueux et inclusif et sont encourag√©s √† signaler tout comportement contraire √† la
pr√©sente politique dont ils font l‚Äôexp√©rience, qu‚Äôils observent ou dont ils ont connaissance. Les
responsables sont tenus de signaler toute plainte qu‚Äôils re√ßoivent ou dont ils ont connaissance
√† leur People Business Partner (partenaire commercial des ressources humaines).
Toutes les plaintes ou escalades seront examin√©es et feront l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôune enqu√™te, si
n√©cessaire, et seront trait√©es avec la plus grande confidentialit√© possible. Dataiku interdit toute
mesure de r√©torsion √† l‚Äôencontre des personnes concern√©es qui signalent ou transmettent une
plainte ou participent √† une proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te.
Les employ√©s qui enfreignent cette politique sont soumis √† des mesures disciplinaires
conform√©ment √† la politique disciplinaire de Dataiku, ce qui peut inclure, mais sans s‚Äôy
limiter, le licenciement. Les violations de la politique par des personnes concern√©es non
employ√©es peuvent entra√Æner des actions telles que le renvoi des locaux ou la r√©siliation d‚Äôun
contrat.
Cette politique explique en outre le type de comportement qui ne sera pas tol√©r√©, les
responsabilit√©s des employ√©s et les multiples fa√ßons dont les individus peuvent soulever ou
faire remonter une pr√©occupation concernant un comportement inappropri√© dans le cadre de
cette politique. Elle d√©crit √©galement de mani√®re g√©n√©rale la mani√®re dont les probl√®mes sont
Politique en mati√®re de lieu de travail respectueux et inclusif V 1.0 3
POLITIQUE INTERNE CONFIDENTIELLE DE DATAIKU - NE PAS PARTAGER
trait√©s et la politique de l‚Äôentreprise en mati√®re de repr√©sailles. Elle est soumise aux droits,
r√®gles et proc√©dures locaux.
Caract√©ristiques prot√©g√©es
Dataiku interdit la discrimination ou le harc√®lement sur la base de certaines caract√©ristiques
prot√©g√©es. Les caract√©ristiques prot√©g√©es peuvent varier en fonction du lieu. Ces
caract√©ristiques prot√©g√©es peuvent inclure la r√©alit√© ou la perception :
‚óè la race, la couleur, l‚Äôethnie ou l‚Äôorigine nationale ;
‚óè l‚Äô√¢ge ;
‚óè la religion ou les convictions religieuses ;
‚óè le sexe, y compris la grossesse, l‚Äôaccouchement, l‚Äôallaitement ou les conditions
m√©dicales associ√©es ;
‚óè l‚Äôorientation sexuelle ;
‚óè le genre, l‚Äôidentit√© de genre, l‚Äôexpression de genre, le statut de transgenre ou les
st√©r√©otypes sexuels ;
‚óè la nationalit√©, le statut d‚Äôimmigration, la citoyennet√© ou l‚Äôascendance ;
‚óè l‚Äô√©tat civil ;
‚óè le statut de militaire ou d‚Äôancien combattant prot√©g√© ;
‚óè le handicap physique ou mental, l‚Äô√©tat de sant√©, l‚Äôinformation ou les caract√©ristiques
g√©n√©tiques (d‚Äôun employ√© ou d‚Äôun membre de sa famille) ;
‚óè le statut de victime de violence domestique, d‚Äôagression sexuelle ou de harc√®lement ;
ou
‚óè tout autre motif interdit par le droit f√©d√©ral, √©tatique ou local.
Discrimination sur le lieu de travail
Nous sommes fiers d‚Äô√™tre un employeur qui respecte l‚Äô√©galit√© des chances. Toutes les
pratiques en mati√®re d‚Äôemploi sont fond√©es sur les besoins de l‚Äôentreprise, sans tenir compte
des caract√©ristiques prot√©g√©es. Cela s‚Äôapplique √† toutes les politiques et proc√©dures li√©es au
recrutement et √† l‚Äôembauche, √† la r√©mun√©ration, aux avantages, aux performances, √† la
promotion et √† la cessation d‚Äôemploi, ainsi qu‚Äô√† toutes les autres conditions d‚Äôemploi.
Dataiku interdit toute activit√© de discrimination sur le lieu de travail ou dans un environnement
de travail √©quivalent √† l‚Äôencontre de toute personne concern√©e. La discrimination comprend
tout comportement ou toute conduite qui a pour effet d‚Äôaffecter n√©gativement les conditions
d‚Äôemploi d‚Äôune personne en raison de ses caract√©ristiques prot√©g√©es. Les exemples de
discrimination sur le lieu de travail comprennent, sans s‚Äôy limiter, la r√©duction de l‚Äô√©valuation
des performances d‚Äôun employ√©, le refus d‚Äôune promotion ou le placement d‚Äôun employ√© dans
un plan d‚Äôam√©lioration des performances en raison de ses caract√©ristiques prot√©g√©es.
Harc√®lement sur le lieu de travail
Le harc√®lement comprend tout comportement verbal ou physique importun fond√© sur les
caract√©ristiques prot√©g√©es d‚Äôune personne et cr√©ant un environnement de travail hostile ou
intimidant.
Le harc√®lement peut se pr√©senter sous diff√©rentes formes d‚Äôactions directes ou moins
directes. Bien que cette liste d‚Äôexemples ne soit pas exhaustive, les actions intol√©rables
comprennent :
‚óè les plaisanteries, farces ou commentaires d√©sobligeants ou insensibles ;
‚óè les insultes ou les √©pith√®tes discriminatoires ;
‚óè les comportements non verbaux tels que le regard fixe, le lorgnon ou les gestes ;
‚óè les commentaires ridicules ou d√©gradants ;
‚óè un comportement mena√ßant, intimidant ou hostile ;
‚óè l‚Äôutilisation intentionnellement erron√©e des pronoms pr√©f√©r√©s d‚Äôune personne ;

‚óè l‚Äôaffichage ou le partage d‚Äôimages offensantes telles que des affiches, des vid√©os, des
photos, des dessins anim√©s, des √©conomiseurs d‚Äô√©cran, des e-mails ou des dessins
qui sont d√©sobligeants ;
‚óè des commentaires offensants sur l‚Äôapparence ou d‚Äôautres caract√©ristiques personnelles
ou physiques, tels que des commentaires sur le handicap physique ou la tenue
religieuse d‚Äôune personne ; ou
‚óè les contacts corporels inutiles ou non d√©sir√©s, tels que le blocage des mouvements
normaux ou l‚Äôinterf√©rence physique avec le travail d‚Äôune autre personne.
Harc√®lement sur le lieu de travail
Le harc√®lement sexuel comprend tout comportement verbal ou physique importun qui vise une
personne en raison de son identit√© ou de son expression de genre (per√ßue ou r√©elle), ou qui
est de nature sexuelle. Le harc√®lement sexuel comprend le harc√®lement fond√© sur le sexe,
l‚Äôorientation sexuelle, le sexe auto-identifi√© ou per√ßu, l‚Äôexpression de genre, l‚Äôidentit√© de genre
et le statut de transgenre. Le harc√®lement sexuel englobe toutes les formes de discrimination
fond√©e sur le sexe, y compris les st√©r√©otypes li√©s au r√¥le des hommes et des femmes et le fait
de traiter les employ√©s diff√©remment en raison de leur sexe. Le harc√®lement ne doit pas
n√©cessairement √™tre motiv√© par des intentions sexuelles. Dans certaines juridictions (comme √†
New York), le harc√®lement n‚Äôa pas besoin d‚Äô√™tre grave ou g√©n√©ralis√© pour √™tre ill√©gal.
Les paragraphes suivants d√©crivent certains types d‚Äôactes qui peuvent constituer un
harc√®lement sexuel ill√©gal et qui sont strictement interdits. Bien que cette liste d‚Äôexemples ne
soit pas exhaustive, les actions intol√©rables comprennent :
‚óè Les actes physiques de nature sexuelle, tels que toucher, pincer, caresser, embrasser,
enlacer, saisir, fr√¥ler le corps d‚Äôun autre employ√© ou lui donner un coup de coude ;
‚óè Commentaires, avances ou propositions de nature sexuelle non d√©sir√©s, tels que des
demandes de faveurs sexuelles accompagn√©es de menaces implicites ou explicites
concernant l‚Äô√©valuation des performances professionnelles de la personne vis√©e, une
promotion ou d‚Äôautres avantages professionnels ; pressions subtiles ou √©videntes en
vue d‚Äôactivit√©s sexuelles importunes ; demandes r√©p√©t√©es de rendez-vous ou de
gestes romantiques, y compris l‚Äôoffre de cadeaux ;
‚óè Les gestes, bruits, remarques ou plaisanteries √† caract√®re sexuel, ou les questions et
commentaires sur la sexualit√©, l‚Äôexp√©rience sexuelle ou l‚Äôhistoire sentimentale d‚Äôune
personne, qui cr√©ent un environnement de travail hostile. Cela ne se limite pas aux
interactions en personne. Les remarques faites sur des plateformes virtuelles et dans
des applis de messagerie lorsque les employ√©s travaillent √† distance peuvent cr√©er un
environnement de travail hostile similaire ;
‚óè Les st√©r√©otypes sexuels, qui se produisent lorsque la conduite ou les traits de
personnalit√© d‚Äôune personne sont jug√©s en fonction des id√©es ou des perceptions
d‚Äôautres personnes sur la fa√ßon dont les individus d‚Äôun sexe particulier devraient agir
ou avoir l‚Äôair, y compris les remarques concernant l‚Äôexpression de genre d‚Äôun employ√©,
comme le port d‚Äôun v√™tement typiquement associ√© √† une identit√© de genre diff√©rente ;
ou le fait de demander aux employ√©s d‚Äôassumer des r√¥les traditionnellement genr√©s ;
‚óè L‚Äôaffichage ou le partage d‚Äôimages offensantes telles que des affiches, des vid√©os, des
photos, des dessins anim√©s, des √©conomiseurs d‚Äô√©cran, des e-mails ou des dessins de
nature obsc√®ne ou sexuelle, y compris dans le cadre d‚Äôun espace de travail virtuel ou √†
distance et peut inclure le fait d‚Äôavoir de tels mat√©riaux visibles en arri√®re-plan de son
domicile lors d‚Äôune r√©union virtuelle.
‚óè Les actes hostiles commis √† l‚Äôencontre d‚Äôune personne en raison de son sexe, de son
orientation sexuelle, de son identit√© de genre ou de son expression de genre, tels que
le sabotage du travail d‚Äôune personne, les brimades, les cris ou les injures, l‚Äôabus
intentionnel des pronoms pr√©f√©r√©s d‚Äôune personne ou la cr√©ation d‚Äôattentes diff√©rentes
√† l‚Äô√©gard des personnes en fonction de leur identit√© per√ßue.

Violence sur le lieu de travail
Dataiku s‚Äôengage √† maintenir un environnement de travail exempt de violence. Toute violence
ou menace de violence √† l‚Äôencontre d‚Äôun employ√©, d‚Äôun client, d‚Äôun vendeur, d‚Äôun visiteur ou
de toute autre personne concern√©e sur le lieu de travail ou par le biais de tout syst√®me de
communication √©lectronique utilis√© √† Dataiku est interdite. Cela inclut les d√©clarations ou la
conduite faites en plaisantant, toute activit√© qui peut √™tre per√ßue comme mena√ßante, ou toute
action qui peut potentiellement entra√Æner un pr√©judice physique ou des dommages √† un
individu, √† ses biens ou √† toute propri√©t√© de Dataiku.
Intimidation sur le lieu de travail
L‚Äô¬´ intimidation ¬ª (c‚Äôest-√†-dire un comportement abusif) viole √©galement les valeurs de respect
et d‚Äôinclusion de Dataiku et est √©galement interdite. Les brimades sont des comportements
offensants, intimidants, malveillants ou insultants qui font qu‚Äôune personne raisonnable se sent
vuln√©rable, boulevers√©e, humili√©e, min√©e ou menac√©e. Les brimades peuvent prendre la
forme d‚Äôun comportement physique, verbal ou non verbal.
Exemples de comportements abusifs :
‚óè Crier apr√®s les autres, √™tre sarcastique √† leur √©gard, les ridiculiser ou les rabaisser.
‚óè Conduite verbale ou non verbale de nature mena√ßante, intimidante ou humiliante ;
‚óè Remarques d√©sobligeantes inappropri√©es, humiliantes, exag√©r√©es ou fausses sur les
performances d‚Äôune personne, en particulier devant d‚Äôautres personnes.
‚óè Abus d‚Äôautorit√© ou de pouvoir de la part de ceux qui occupent une position
d‚Äôanciennet√©
‚óè L‚Äôexclusion d√©lib√©r√©e d‚Äôune personne de r√©unions ou de communications sans raison
valable, ou le fait d‚Äôencourager d‚Äôautres personnes √† le faire.
Les brimades peuvent se produire en face √† face, dans un contexte de groupe, par le biais de
plates-formes de communication ou d‚Äôe-mails, ou par le biais de comm√©rages.
L‚Äôintimidation sur le lieu de travail ne doit pas √™tre confondue avec l‚Äôattribution non abusive de
t√¢ches par la direction, l‚Äôencadrement et la r√©primande ou la prise d‚Äôactions disciplinaires
appropri√©es. Cette politique ne doit pas √™tre interpr√©t√©e comme limitant les efforts
raisonnables des responsables pour g√©rer leurs employ√©s. Une critique l√©gitime, raisonnable
et constructive des performances ou du comportement d‚Äôun travailleur, ou des instructions
raisonnables donn√©es aux employ√©s dans le cadre de leur travail, ne constitueront pas en
elles-m√™mes des brimades ou un comportement abusif.
Repr√©sailles
Dataiku interdit les repr√©sailles √† l‚Äôencontre de toute personne qui signale, ou a l‚Äôintention de
signaler, une violation ou une violation pr√©sum√©e de la pr√©sente politique, ou qui participe √† la
proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te relative √† une r√©clamation signal√©e. Les violations peuvent concerner le
harc√®lement, le harc√®lement sexuel, la discrimination ou la violence. Les repr√©sailles sont des
mesures d√©favorables prises √† l‚Äôencontre d‚Äôune personne parce qu‚Äôelle a soulev√© une plainte
ou y a particip√©. Quelques exemples de repr√©sailles incluent, sans s‚Äôy limiter, l‚Äôabsence
d‚Äôenqu√™te sur les plaintes des employ√©s, le licenciement apr√®s avoir d√©pos√© une plainte, une
√©valuation n√©gative apr√®s le d√©p√¥t d‚Äôune plainte, la modification des t√¢ches professionnelles
de mani√®re √† ce qu‚Äôelles soient plus difficiles √† ex√©cuter ou la r√©trogradation des fonctions.
Les repr√©sailles exerc√©es √† l‚Äôencontre d‚Äôune personne constituent une violation de la pr√©sente
politique et feront l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôune action disciplinaire. Si vous subissez des repr√©sailles, veillez √†
en prendre note, √† les signaler et √† en informer votre partenaire commercial des ressources
humaines dans les plus brefs d√©lais.
Politique en mati√®re de lieu de travail respectueux et inclusif V 1.0 6
POLITIQUE INTERNE CONFIDENTIELLE DE DATAIKU - NE PAS PARTAGER
ACTIONS DE SIGNALEMENT ET D‚ÄôENQU√äTE
En France, DATAIKU a mis en place une proc√©dure sp√©cifique de signalement conforme √† ses
obligations l√©gales en vertu du droit fran√ßais.
Cette proc√©dure garantit que DATAIKU est en mesure de traiter efficacement les signalements
d'abus ou de comportements inappropri√©s sur le lieu de travail et de prot√©ger ceux qui les font.
Par cons√©quent, la protection l√©gale accord√©e aux lanceurs d'alerte en vertu du droit fran√ßais
ne s'appliquera qu'aux travailleurs dont le signalement est fait conform√©ment √† la proc√©dure
sp√©cifique pr√©vue dans la ""Charte sur la proc√©dure d'alerte"".
Les violations de la pr√©sente politique seront trait√©es rapidement et de mani√®re appropri√©e.
Les actions qui en d√©coulent peuvent inclure des mesures disciplinaires pouvant aller jusqu‚Äôau
licenciement, une formation obligatoire, l‚Äôorientation vers des services de conseil, le suivi du
contrevenant et/ou des mesures disciplinaires, la r√©affectation ou la suspension temporaire
sans solde.
Signaler un probl√®me
Chaque employ√© et personne concern√©e a la responsabilit√© d‚Äôaider √† la mise en ≈ìuvre des
politiques sur le travail de Dataiku afin de soutenir l‚Äôapplication du lieu de travail respectueux
et inclusif de Dataiku. Si vous observez ou avez connaissance d‚Äôun comportement inappropri√©
susceptible d‚Äôenfreindre cette politique, vous devez imm√©diatement le signaler. Les employ√©s
sont encourag√©s, mais ne sont pas oblig√©s, de communiquer leur malaise √† ceux qui, selon
eux, ont un comportement inappropri√©. Par ailleurs, les violations potentielles de la pr√©sente
politique peuvent √™tre signal√©es par l‚Äôun des canaux suivants :
‚óè Vous pouvez signaler l‚Äôincident, verbalement ou par √©crit, √† votre sup√©rieur ou √† tout
autre responsable de l‚Äôorganisation avec lequel vous vous sentez √† l‚Äôaise.
‚óè Vous pouvez signaler l‚Äôincident √† un partenaire commercial des ressources humaines
ou √† un membre de l‚Äô√©quipe DEC .
‚óã Les salari√©s en France peuvent √©galement choisir de contacter le Comit√© social
et √©conomique (CSE) √† cse.dataiku.ext@gmail.com.
‚óè Vous pouvez signaler l‚Äôincident de mani√®re anonyme en contactant Ethicspoint.
Fonctions d‚Äôun responsable
Dataiku attend davantage des responsables qu‚Äôils se conforment √† un lieu de travail
respectueux et inclusif et qu‚Äôils en fassent la promotion. Comme tous les employ√©s, les
responsables sont tenus d‚Äôagir conform√©ment √† cette politique et feront l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôune action
disciplinaire s‚Äôils s‚Äôengagent, ignorent, tol√®rent ou agissent en violation de cette politique (par
exemple, une conduite de harc√®lement sexuel). En outre, si un employ√© fait part d‚Äôune
pr√©occupation directement √† un responsable, ce dernier est tenu de la transmettre
imm√©diatement √† son partenaire commercial des ressources humaines. Les responsables qui
ne transmettent pas une pr√©occupation ou qui adoptent des comportements de repr√©sailles √†
l‚Äô√©gard de l‚Äôemploy√© qui a soulev√© la pr√©occupation feront l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôune action disciplinaire,
pouvant aller jusqu‚Äôau licenciement.
Gestion d‚Äôun probl√®me
Si la situation signal√©e n√©cessite une intervention de l‚Äô√©quipe des ressources humaines ou du
membre du CSE, la pr√©occupation sera transmise √† l‚Äô√©quipe appropri√©e et form√©e pour
entamer la proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te afin de d√©terminer la r√©solution appropri√©e. Nous traitons les
Politique en mati√®re de lieu de travail respectueux et inclusif V 1.0 7
POLITIQUE INTERNE CONFIDENTIELLE DE DATAIKU - NE PAS PARTAGER
enqu√™tes de la mani√®re la plus confidentielle possible, en ne divulguant des informations qu‚Äôen
cas de besoin. Nous ne pouvons pas garantir une confidentialit√© absolue, car il se peut que
nous devions divulguer tout ou partie des informations que nous recueillons pour examiner et
r√©soudre le probl√®me.
L‚Äôapproche de l‚Äôenqu√™te peut varier en fonction des circonstances ou des exigences locales.
En r√®gle g√©n√©rale, l‚Äô√©quipe d‚Äôenqu√™te recueillera autant de d√©tails que possible sur la
situation, rassemblera et examinera des documents et des donn√©es dans la mesure du
possible, proc√©dera √† un examen complet de tous les d√©tails et d√©terminera une r√©solution
appropri√©e.
Proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te
Afin de soutenir un lieu de travail respectueux et inclusif, Dataiku prend au s√©rieux toutes les
violations pr√©sum√©es de cette politique. Chaque situation est diff√©rente et la fa√ßon dont nous
abordons votre pr√©occupation peut varier en fonction des exigences locales. Nous nous
engageons √† mener des enqu√™tes et des investigations et √† prendre les mesures appropri√©es
en temps opportun.
Les employ√©s qui sont invit√©s √† participer doivent coop√©rer √† la proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te et fournir
des informations compl√®tes et v√©ridiques tout au long de la proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te. Au cours des
conversations individuelles, des notes peuvent √™tre prises ou il peut √™tre demand√© aux
personnes de consigner leurs informations par √©crit.
1. La proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te comprendra des conversations individuelles avec les
personnes impliqu√©es dans la situation afin de comprendre toute la port√©e de ce qui
s‚Äôest pass√©. Il peut s‚Äôagir de conversations individuelles avec les personnes qui ont
signal√© la pr√©occupation, les t√©moins de la situation, toute personne ayant v√©cu des
circonstances similaires et toute personne au sujet de laquelle le probl√®me est soulev√©.
2. Le cas √©ch√©ant, il peut √™tre demand√© aux personnes de fournir et de pr√©senter des
documents ou des donn√©es pour corroborer ou fournir un contexte suppl√©mentaire aux
d√©clarations ou aux all√©gations faites.
3. Au cours d‚Äôune enqu√™te active, une intervention imm√©diate (telle qu‚Äôune suspension)
peut s‚Äôav√©rer n√©cessaire pour garantir qu‚Äôaucun autre pr√©judice n‚Äôest caus√© aux
personnes ou √† l‚Äôentreprise. Si aucune intervention n‚Äôest n√©cessaire, toutes les
personnes participant √† l‚Äôenqu√™te sont cens√©es s‚Äôacquitter normalement de leurs
responsabilit√©s professionnelles et pr√©server la confidentialit√© de leur participation √† la
proc√©dure d‚Äôenqu√™te.
4. √Ä l‚Äôissue d‚Äôune enqu√™te approfondie, l‚Äôentreprise d√©terminera les mesures appropri√©es
√† prendre. La r√©solution appropri√©e et les mesures correctives seront communiqu√©es
aux parties concern√©es. L‚Äôauteur du signalement sera inform√© de la cl√¥ture de
l‚Äôenqu√™te, mais il se peut qu‚Äôil ne soit pas inform√© des d√©tails du r√©sultat afin de
prot√©ger la confidentialit√© et la vie priv√©e de toutes les personnes impliqu√©es, √† moins
que le droit local n‚Äôen dispose autrement.
