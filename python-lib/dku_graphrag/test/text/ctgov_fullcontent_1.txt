Detailed Description
This is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective study of an extended wear infusion set in adults with Type 1 diabetes using a Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology with continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). Up to 300 participants across the United States age 18-80 will be enrolled in up to 20 investigational centers. Participants will change insulin cartridge every 48 to 72 hours as recommended by their health care provider. Participants will be expected to participate in the study for approximately 12-16 weeks.
