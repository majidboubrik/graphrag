## Subtitle: For Aviva auditing core business processes
### Main sections:
#### Quote 1
I've never used process mining before, but I knew what process mining was and how powerful it can be, and I was keen to use it.

Taking the claims teams on that journey, showing them exactly how we’re seeing what’s in the data, gives them a level of control and insight that you don’t get from just providing results in another format.

Tom Adams, Internal Audit Manager
---
#### Quote 2
If we wanted to get to the same level of comfort or knowledge, we'd have to spend probably 3 or 4 times the amount of time that we spend on process mining. And we would then be potentially missing outliers or strange paths that process mining reveals to us. We wouldn't be able to provide the same level of insight to management.

What we do in audit is then used by the business itself. And that has direct customer impact.

~Francisco Pavão Martins, Sr Manager of Data Analytics

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

“Global Luxury Group” showcases how a historically decentralized Group (built by external acquisitions of independent brands and business lines) with low data & AI maturity skills adopted a centralized Data Factory model. Under the strong leadership of their CIO & CDO, “Global Luxury Group” built a common platform, implemented best practices, and developed use cases to improve the overall value of data projects and accelerate time-to-market.


Main Transformation Steps

Over the past three years, “Global Luxury Group” has made significant strides in advancing its AI maturity. As a historically decentralized organization that expanded through external acquisitions, “Global Luxury Group” encountered challenges across its diverse Maisons (75 Maisons in 6 regions across 5 business groups). The Group could achieve significant improvements by addressing their encountered pain points such as slow time to market and low value from data & AI projects, costly and complex infrastructure, as well as limited availability of data experts at BU level.

Leading the way within the Group, one Maison became the pioneer to embark on the data and AI journey back in 2017 by equipping a Data Science team of 12 people with Dataiku. In 2019, “Global Luxury Group” launched the Data Accelerator Initiative, a significant undertaking that played a pivotal role in the later creation of the Group’s Data Factory. Established in late 2021, the Data Factory aims to accelerate time to market through common tools, practices & reuse, and empower the Maisons within the organization. It now comprises 70 full-time employees, encompassing a well-balanced mix of technical, data, and business expertise.

“Global Luxury Group” has initiated a move toward a Hub & Spoke model, aiming to delegate more responsibilities to the individual Maisons & ultimately business users. As part of this approach, Business Group Data Leads have been appointed, although it should be noted that this transition is still in its early stages.

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

With a strong reliance on Dataiku and by leveraging diverse data sources, Unilever has strategically developed a robust plugin library that allows Data Analysts to respond swiftly to the needs of Marketers. Their streamlined data project lifecycle ensures timely insights and quick responsiveness to business needs.


Main Transformation Steps

In 2017, Unilever initiated its Data & AI transformation journey by partnering with Capgemini to a Data Marketing Hub. This center heavily relies on Dataiku as a prominent tool in its operations. The Hub is under the supervision of the CMO and strives to harness the potential of a wide array of data sources. For instance, it enables Unilever to extract valuable insights from social media through the application of natural language processing (NLP).

Between 2018 and 2020, Unilever created a customized plugin library to enhance automation and scalability. Moreover, efforts were directed at reducing employee turnover, fostering skill enhancement across varied profiles, and solidifying governance structures alongside scalable processes, encompassing both customer and technical interactions. This period also witnessed the collaborative development of a metric-driven roadmap, aimed at steering strategic initiatives.

In 2021, Unilever began moving a part of the Hub operations from AWS to Azure, opening opportunities for enhanced collaboration with the Data & Analytics (D&A) team, as both are now integrated within the same cloud infrastructure.

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

Standard Chartered stands out as a prominent international banking group with a rich history of over 150 years worldwide. The pivotal moment in their data transformation journey happened between 2016 & 2018 when the Financial Planning and Analysis team adopted analytics to simplify their daily manual tasks, reliant on spreadsheets & legacy tools. The remarkable success in productivity and efficiency quickly attracted the attention of other divisions. This resulted in the rapid adoption of analytics & AI, upskilling analysts, and replacing legacy tools across the organization, notably, Dataiku emerged as the preferred enterprise tool for this transformation.

Main Transformation Steps

Back in 2016, Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) explored the usage of AI in their reporting functions. They were facing a huge problem which was that they had 2 accounting systems, multiple currencies, and thousands of cost centers, and had to report problems involving 500 million moving pieces, using a spreadsheet process to do that. By implementing Dataiku, they improved their financial analysts' productivity by a factor of 30, saving hours of manual and repetitive tasks, by automating complex data workflows. After this successful experiment, 
they decided to upskill their team with DS techniques.
The remarkable success in productivity and efficiency quickly attracted the attention of other divisions, first within the Financial teams, and then into the core Foundation Services & Technology Strategy team (FSTS), and Retail Banking.

In 2020, Standard Chartered identified a strong, enterprise-wide demand for a robust data analytics platform that could handle large volumes of data and provide the flexibility required to enable a range of different roles and profiles. Across the board, there was no doubt that Dataiku was the right solution for the data analytics internal needs, during this year an increase of 250 licenses consolidated Dataiku as an enterprise tool.

By 2021, there was a growing interest in advancing AI and machine learning (ML) as a regular component of data analytics in the bank. A dedicated team in Enterprise Technology built and designed the Citizen Data Science Training Program to familiarize users with Dataiku and the fundamentals of data science and ML practices. Until 2023 this program onboarded +800 analysts. During 2021 - 2023, legacy tools such as Paxata, and Datarobot were completely replaced by Dataiku, in parallel there have been migrations from SAS and Alteryx into Dataiku across different teams.

The goal in the coming years is to continue upskilling teams with Dataiku, to increase efficiency across more areas of Standard Chartered Bank through the industrialization of governed self-service analytics along with the transition to a CDP Cloud in Azure (planned to be completed by the end of 2024).

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

A leading global investment bank achieved unparalleled growth and efficiency through Dataiku. Their journey began in the Private Bank Wealth Management sector, and swiftly expanded across the entire organization. With the power of analytics, data, and AI working seamlessly to drive success. To make this possible, they established a Center of Excellence and a robust onboarding system, ensuring a smooth experience for every user. This success story exemplifies how Dataiku empowers diverse teams, democratizing data access across the entire organization, yielding unparalleled results. 
Main Transformation Steps

Prior to 2018, the Bank faced several data & AI pain points:
Pipeline to production took multiple offshore teams months to complete
Lack of trust from users to use any platform for important projects
Need for a reliable platform: Transition from Hadoop to Alpine failed

In 2018 the Bank rolled out a new capability to aid their Financial Advisors in their interactions with clients, built with Dataiku. They named it, Next Best Action, an AI-based recommendation engine for personalized investment and wealth management ideas. The NBA system was used for communications, making a typical message tailored and sent out in about ten minutes. The automatically-sent message can include the specific impact on the client’s portfolio, the system also recommends a set of investment ideas that FAs can send to clients, ideas to engage.

Fast forward to 2019-2021, a wave of democratization swept across divisions. This period marked the inception of a Center of Excellence, dedicated to business users onboarding & support. In August 2019, the migration from the legacy tool to Dataiku was successfully accomplished.

The year 2022 brought a new focus – the creation of a robust, programmatic approach for Dataiku onboarding. This strategic move aimed to streamline user onboarding, making the process more efficient and user-friendly.

In 2023, the expansion journey continues, with the Center of Excellence now touching approximately 1/3rd of the entire organization.

Full voice-over & detailed information

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

“Major French Bank” showcases how a multinational bank successfully transitioned from a decentralized model with relatively autonomous BUs to a Hub & Spoke framework, driven by the recognition of data as a strategic pillar. With the number of Dataiku users growing from about 50 to over 300, the Group now also has more than 330 AI and data use cases in production (not only Dataiku UCs), which exemplifies the benefits of combining centralized guidance with flexibility at BU level and the positive outcomes of rationalizing tools.


People & Change

The former Group CEO emphasized “Major French Bank’s” ongoing cultural and technological transformation, reinforcing digital maturity across businesses and geographies. Responsible use of data, particularly with AI, is a strategic asset for improving existing models and developing new business approaches. The Group’s new CEO has been appointed in May 2023.

“Major French Bank” conducted a digital event called Techweek in 2021, reaching its 133,000 staff worldwide. Through a global awareness and training program in the same year, nearly 5,000 employees in 25 countries were trained, with 2,000 receiving qualifications. Since Dataiku supports a wide range of programming languages, it led to fast adoption among users by 2022 and RISQ analysts could independently lead data science projects once upskilled. In 2023, an educational catalog featured events like the popular quarterly Dataiku session. Furthermore, the company aims to train 18,000 managers through a Data Literacy program between 2023 and 2025.

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

GE Aerospace exemplifies data-driven efficiency, from high-level executives to individual employees. Their Self-Service Data program plays a pivotal role in unlocking employees’ capacity to swiftly derive valuable insights from data. It also ensures robust governance during the transition from the design to the production environment, a transition that can be accomplished with just one click.


Main Transformation Steps

Until 2015, the data utilization process at GE Aerospace involved business users requesting data extracts from the IT team in Excel format to prepare reports for the leadership team. However, this manual and time-consuming process presented several challenges. Firstly, it led to potential inaccuracies and errors in the final reports due to the manual data comparisons. Secondly, the lack of real-time access to data hindered the leadership team’s ability to make agile decisions. Thirdly, the dependency on IT for data retrieval created bottlenecks and delays. Fourthly, inconsistent data formats complicated data integration and validation. These inefficiencies, along with the absence of a central vision and standards for data usage, underscored the necessity for a more streamlined and self-service-oriented data ecosystem to empower business users and improve data-driven decision-making.

To address these challenges, GE Aerospace created the Digital League in 2016. It comprises a cross-functional team with leaders from Engineering, Supply Chain, Finance, IT, and business lines, who come together under one central vision and strategy and are located within the same physical workspace. Their primary objective is the creation of data-centric products and all data-related endeavors are funneled through this dedicated team.

In 2017, the Self-Service Data initiative was launched, empowering users of various profiles to independently manage data tasks and leverage their domain expertise. Data Scientists handle complex projects, while business users are encouraged to reuse data projects stored in a data lake. An intuitive tag system ensures easy data access, and built-in macros facilitate a seamless transition from design to production, significantly improving the data management process and making it accessible, collaborative, and highly efficient.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company implemented a workforce reduction of 20% to 25% across all departments. This reduction affected many consultants, as well as those involved in Dataiku projects. The challenges for Dataiku became more apparent in 2021 when champions and advocates left GE Aerospace.

In 2022, a shift occurred as the company transitioned from on-premises systems to AWS. This transition spanned 15 months and ended up exceeding the budget by approximately USD 10 million. Consequently, there was a need to meticulously assess every software component in order to implement budget cuts. However, recently there has been a gradual restoration of some budget allocations, particularly in areas such as machine learning work. Moreover, they have focused on reinforcing data governance.

## Project stakeholders
Key stakeholders included the Data League, which provided a centralized entity to build a common vision and execute complex cross-functional projects, supported by two teams: the Self-Service Data Team and the Database Admin Team.

## Business transformation story
To address challenges, GE Aerospace initiated the Self-Service Data Initiative in 2017 to empower business users to explore data and automate data pipeline deployment. The transformation included the creation of the Digital League and enhancements in data governance from 2020 through 2023. In terms of key figures, there are over 800 designers and a few hundred analysts involved across more than 2,300 Dataiku development projects and 500+ automation projects. Data governance reinforces the integrity of data entering production.

## Value
The transformation has delivered annual benefits exceeding $0.5 billion from AI and data projects, with less than 2 minutes to push projects to production, significantly enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness.

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

With 9 R&D centers around the world, 123 production sites in 26 countries, a commercial presence in 170 countries, and 125,000 employees worldwide, this organization exemplifies how an iconic manufacturing group seized the opportunity to infuse data & AI in most of its operations to differentiate on its core activities (Tyres R&D, Manufacturing…) as well as tap into new market opportunities (Services…). They have been a pioneer in successfully implementing a data mesh strategy and democratizing analytics & AI for engineers and domain experts through a self-service approach.
Main Transformation Steps

Their digital & data transformation started around 2014 with a focus on its IT foundations: the goal was to make data more accessible by progressively opening its IT software monoliths and have the data stored on on-premise data lakes, which was achieved by 2018. Though this was already a major achievement, some challenges remained: 
Reliance on data experts with coding skills to extract and analyze business data
Poor business data governance & interoperability lead to time-consuming, manual data reconciliation

During 2019 and 2020, tackled these challenges by implementing a data mesh strategy following 3 core pillars:
Distributed data domains (R&D, Manufacturing…) aiming at facilitating data usability by consumers (data or business experts) through the publication of data products
Federated governance with Data Offices creation in the main BUs
(Hybrid) Data Platforms, acknowledging the weakness of a one-size-fits-all solution, with a mix of on-prem and cloud data platforms to meet specific business & confidentiality needs (R&D, Manufacturing, Services…)

In April 2021, implemented Dataiku for the first time in its Digital Manufacturing activities (35 Designers), marking new steps towards data democratization and self-service analytics for domain experts.

2022 saw an expansion of Dataiku in Digital Manufacturing, Corporate Functions, New services, and R&D (55 Designers, both data experts & domain experts). 2023 saw a real acceleration for Digital Manufacturing with 100 users onboarded (250+ in total at Group level) in the first Leading Digital Factories, along with 20 factories.2024 saw an ELA. As of Oct 2024, there are 700 Dataiku users (20% Data Experts, 80% business experts):
400 Manufacturing
190 Corporate Functions AICP & Ultim
110 Engineering and Rest



# AI assistant summary
## Customer transformation story
This is the summary of a business transformation story made by a Leading Tire Manufacturer.

## Context and challenges
The organization faced challenges with accessing on-premise and confidential data from factories and IoT products. There was a reliance on data experts for business data analysis and poor business data governance, leading to time-consuming manual data reconciliation.

# Customer transformation stories / speaker notes 

Full voice-over & detailed information

30-Second Transformation Pitch for Prospects

“American Pharma Co” demonstrates a distinct organizational structure comprising regional Hub & Spoke models, which bolster responsiveness and relevance to local needs, along with a global Hub for inter-geographical coordination, focused on sharing global knowledge and standardizing work processes across the entire organization. This combination allows them to effectively address both local demands and global alignment within the company.


Main Transformation Steps

Before implementing a data science and machine learning platform like Dataiku, “American Pharma Co’s” data science ecosystem faced several challenges. Collaboration between employees with different profiles (data & business) was difficult as a result of the organizational silos. Data science solutions were developed using code-based environments like Python, R, and SQL, which were perceived as black-box environments by non-Data Scientists, making it difficult to operationalize projects effectively. Data Scientists had to take on various roles beyond their typical responsibilities, such as business analyst, project manager, data engineer, impacting their ability to focus on pure data science innovation. Although they managed these tasks, it came at the expense of deeper, pure data science innovation. Moreover, resource limitations forced the data science teams to prioritize exploring new opportunities over dedicating time to in-depth data science pursuits.

To address these challenges, the field of data science has undergone significant transformations at “American Pharma Co” over the years, with an evolution from a domain limited to specialists in 2013 to a period of substantial growth and value demonstration from 2014 to 2017. The integration of Dataiku in the following years as well as the transition to a Hub & Spoke model played a crucial role in bridging the gap between Data Scientists and Data Analysts. The years 2020 and 2021 saw a phase of data science acceleration, characterized by structured execution and more autonomy for Data Analysts. As data science became more accessible and refined, the user base surged significantly, reaching over 750 users in 2022/2023, representing the systemization of data science within the organization.

Full voice-over & detailed information

30-Second Transformation Pitch for ProspectsLeading Telco exemplifies a company that transitioned from a decentralized & uncoordinated model to a Hub & Spoke model, empowering business analysts & data experts to choose tools based on their preferences (Dataiku or Vertex AI). With a strategy emphasizing self-service access to tools and data, Leading Telco has effectively implemented concepts such as AI as a service and data as a Service, with proper user training & support, and without compromising governance (use case portfolio management, value management, security & ethics) by central Hub. 

Main Transformation Steps

Around 2017, Leading Telco encountered challenges including functional silos, limited use cases, and disconnected data sources, which hindered operationalization and business impact. Its vision was to move from traditional analytics based on business rules to modern analytics leveraging machine learning techniques and associated tools. To achieve this objective and to hire young Data Scientists who were seeking dynamic open source tools, Leading Telco decided to progressively decommission SAS (2017-2020) & moved to a more modern data stack (GCP + Dataiku)

In 2020, the Digital Acceleration & AI program was initiated to federate all data initiatives within France BU, posing the basis of a Hub & Spoke Model. The Hub progressively set up governance guidelines and structured a service offering with tools and training.

---
#### The Approach
- After scoping and deep-diving into a first project to migrate, the partner developed it entirely as a Dataiku project in their partner environment then imported it in the customer environment.
- Then partner and customer worked with configuration for applying database connection configuration and REST API connection for parallel run and checks to sign-off to decommission the flow.
- This approach involves both SAS coder and Python builder skills and requires alignment on the target implementation style (full code or hybrid, Python/GUI).

#### From
SAS code and Python code in SAS Viya  
2600 steps, 24 programs, 2 input data sources  

After calculating factory production line indicators by the Python script in SAS Viya, the operator confirms whether the calculated value seems good or not. After this human-in-the loop check, output is sent to the factory system using REST API.

#### To
Facing performance issues loading data from the input database SQL server, input data was transferred to Snowflake and process then ran on Snowflake.  

**Interactive Dashboard (Python Dash)**  
If calculated value was judged not good, the operator inputs correct value to the Dashboard then through to the factory system via REST API.

#### Context
Orange is one of the largest operators of mobile and internet services in Europe and Africa and a global leader in corporate telecommunication services.

Orange client services data team wanted to work on more cutting-edge use cases but:

Tooling challenges:
- Accessible to coders
- Limited data access
- No ML-based data projects

Hiring challenges:
- Hiring challenges reinforced by legacy tools in place
- Long training needed

---

#### Building a sustainable data practice
With multiple use cases covering various business perimeters and the entire value chain including:
- Call load detection and triage ML in production in less than a month
- Preventing unwanted client charges to improve NPS
- Routing optimisation: traffic churn, reroute the traffic, etc.
- Predictive Maintenance of IT equipments

 - Current ecosystem: ['Snowflake']

 - Long description: Value Generated:
80% of the total effort to build a predictive model taking weeks/months is now reduced to hours of marginal efforts. This enables us to quickly evaluate the quality of the model and decide whether incremental effort is needed to improve it. 

By having quicker access to a wider variety of signals, we can further enrich standard profiles. Marketing stakeholders now have access to more profiling variables in the standard profile, which helps increase the relevancy of our marketing communications. 

Opportunity cost saving: Data Scientists now have more time to invest in more added value projects, such as building more models, whose insights feed back into a more accurate customer understanding. A virtuous flywheel!

Business Solution:
The idea is to democratize the intelligence that we build about our customers. Any logic that a data scientist would run in their code every single time is being crunched once and everyone can benefit from it, instead of reinventing the wheel for every project. This also allows for better governance and for having a single source of truth. We leveraged Dataiku’s visual flows, AutoML & custom ML to connect Customer 360 to Dataiku so that we can easily and quickly fetch multiple potential features and train new predictive models, customer segmentations, and recommender systems in hours instead of week/months.

Aimed at making complex information accessible and engaging for young learners, this initiative has transformed Doopedia, Korea’s answer to Wikipedia, into an easily navigable resource for elementary students in just one month. The project, which remarkably reduced content creation time from one to two days to just one minute, is a notable example of Generative AI’s impact in education. This achievement in digital education underscores the power of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), as seen in Dataiku’s innovative LLM Mesh, to make knowledge more accessible and foster an efficient, engaging learning environment.

 - Long description: Value Generated:
As we’re forecasting demand for NXP’s multi-billion dollar business, the incremental improvements we’re seeing in forecasting accuracy can influence millions of dollars of costs and revenues. Analyzing complex data relationships via machine learning enables our organization to produce more accurate results, in a faster time than ever before. The Dataiku workflow has also enabled some rationalization of IT services that previously extended across multiple applications.

But perhaps the greatest value for NXP is that there’s now greater interest in leveraging ML techniques in supply chain operations. The supply chain organization has since invested for the first time in recruiting classically trained data scientists. Moreover, the organization is working on finding, prioritizing, and developing a pipeline of ML use cases on high-impact issues affecting NXP.

These investments in AI have the potential to unleash 10s of millions of dollars of the returned value to NXP. Additionally, beyond our business and customers, we’re now able to contribute back to the community with this work through our joint research with Eindhoven University, with whom we’re in the process of presenting one of the experiments developed by students at an AI/ML conference in the fall of 2022.

ZS helped the client compare multiple platforms before Dataiku was chosen to be the platform for MLOps. 

Model Runtime improvement: Earlier manual execution models involved multiple handoffs and inefficiencies because they were shared as ZIP files for deployment. By enabling One Click Execution of model prediction and One Click Deployment leveraging Azure DevOps, our team reduced model runtime from 48 hours to as little as six hours, thereby drastically reducing the model go-to-market time from six months to six weeks.

 - Long description: We've also seen the benefits of this broadcasting approach in situations where changes have led to issues. For instance, when we rolled out a change that broke an important process problem, we were able to quickly identify that we had an issue, trace it back to the root cause, roll back the change, and ultimately fix the issue within 24 hours. This transparency allows for quicker identification and resolution of anything that impacts our metrics negatively, as opposed to being solely the responsibility of a small group of people.

 - Long description: The team at Element therefore set out to solve this challenge with a machine learning- and statistics-based approach. With Dataiku, they are now detecting anomalies in battery test results automatically and in near real time, informing personnel to halt the tests early and therefore saving incredible amounts of technician resources.

More specifically, Element used Dataiku to build an intermediator service that screens battery test results in seconds instead of hours. The statistical test runs on streaming data, detecting signal irregularities. As soon as an issue is raised, a member of staff investigates, remediates the situation, and restarts the test if the battery unit is non-faulty. Otherwise, the unit is placed safely, waiting for its return to the customer.

In addition to benefits like reduced customer wait time, resulting in lower customer attrition, Element is also seeing tangible, quantifiable return on investment (ROI) in the form of:

Reducing battery test result screening by up to 95%, which means 90% of technician time is freed up for other high-value tasks.
Halting tests early, which is not only safer for staff but also has increased testing throughput by up to 25%.

Incredibly, the team developed and tested their minimum viable product (MVP) in three months, reaching break even on the project within six months thanks to the tangible value from this single use case.

 - Long description: By moving from a periodic, manual process to an automated Control Test Framework process, RBC CAE Group saves 20-25% of time for a given audit. This gives the auditors insight into the strength of the control environment throughout the year, not simply at a given point of time.

The new process creates greater certainty over the status of the control, allowing auditors the freedom to explore ideas. Not only are significant time savings a benefit, but the quality of assurance is increased. It favours a more accurate view of business health at any given time, which gives decision-makers more time to react if needed.

The platform makes it easy to identify, define, and raise Audit Issues to RBC Business Units on their risk assurance practices. The CAE Group is empowered to explain Control Test results to Regulators in a consistent and transparent way.

This means less time to develop new solutions for the services subscribers which has implications on their ability to grow revenue.

Solution:
- Dataiku's ability to automate MLOps & pipelines at scale

 - Long description: Forecasting Animal Diseases to Inform Prevention and Public Action

As we’re forecasting diseases for a ministry that keeps track of tens of millions of animals, any small indicator of when and where a certain disease will spread will influence unquantifiable amounts of both health and monetary value. The use case predicts and displays the number of animals affected by a certain disease in a certain region in the kingdom for up to 6 months in advance, which allows users to track trends and identify any rate of changes and outbreaks. This eventually helps the ministry track the effectiveness of the disease prevention and health awareness campaigns.

This is the part that I think is the most important. I measure pre when they wanted to have it, when they have it, and then the post weeks. So like 10 weeks after we're actually seeing a sustained lift after the feature ends of another $4 million a week. So it's not even impacting just the baseline of when they wanted to feature this item. It increases the customer's demand more permanently on the items that they've chosen to feature. And we're holding that increase in sales long term.”

I really love the scheduling of Dataiku specifically because you can do SQL, you can do anything you want. You can put it in sequence there and have everything dependent on each other.So if any step of that fails, I'm able to halt the process importantly and not push a bad update. It is just a super powerful scheduling system that is incomparable to the other alternatives we had for sure”

 - Long description: Context:
- As the world leader in the rapidly changing environment of communications technology, Ericsson operates many warehouses on a global scale. Optimizing the use of this space is a key part of Ericsson’s lean supply chain.
- Our project goal is to provide accurate estimates of the space for current and future inventory need. For most of the products stored, the occupied space can be calculated using simple formulas. However, for the remaining products this is not possible, thus historically the estimates of the available space were inaccurate.

Before:
- Impossible to measure every single packaging on a daily basis
- Logic to calculate the size of unknown packaging is unclear, and so complex that it cannot be defined by the business
- No centralized platform to perform the calculation
- Stakeholders require high reporting accuracy

Results: 
- Ericsson saves on real-estate costs, by continuously optimizing the use of the existing warehouses. This is thanks to the more accurate estimates from our project.
- Our project provides operational visibility on demand & a data-driven warehouse space management process.
- Use Case was scaled at Group level

Underlined Dataiku features:
- Eased data access & data prep
- AutoML allowed to test multiple ML algorithms for benchmarking, without having to code them
- Scheduled model retrain
- Automation of the entire flow of pulling data, scoring, and outputting
- Easy scalability & reusability 
- Democratization of Use Case creation to Citizen DSs

 - Long description: The automated workflow, supported by two crucial plug-ins, the LAS file reader, and the LAS export manager, facilitated the efficient extraction of maximum temperature data and its conversion into Excel format. This automation replaced a manual approach that required 10 full-time engineers working for 3 weeks to handle 1000 log files. In contrast, the automated flow took only 2 assigned engineers to work 5 business days including preparing and executing 12,000 received log files simultaneously, ensuring high accuracy, which is a critical factor. The harmonization, normalization, and standardization process improved data quality, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

 - Long description: Epsilon worked with Dataiku to build a real-time decision engine leveraging Dataiku for model development, workflow, and execution, automation node for job scheduling and monitoring, and API node for integrated services to the various applications for batch and real-time processing.

We integrated this solution into the brand's enterprise CRM and email marketing applications to deliver hyper-personalized email experiences. As each email campaign is generated from the marketing teams, the system calls our environment to return the next best actions for things like product recommendations, offers and promotions, best content, and best subject lines.

This sense and response environment ensures that no two emails are ever the same, and each one is uniquely personalized for every customer profile.

The machine learning test groups have outperformed the control groups by 47% for revenue per email open.

The machine learning test groups have driven a 20% lift in conversion rates over the control groups for all emails that were opened.

 - Long description: Customer support of VERBUND Energy4Customers (VEC) needs to quickly and accurately handle ca. 100k customer e-mails p.a. For this to happen, incoming e-mails first have to be assigned to the ‘right person’. Previously, they were classified manually (read → assign to an employee) causing a large number of work hours, delayed customer answers and reduced satisfaction. Soon the e-mail classification will be automated.
Customer e-mails were collected by VEC. VH/HI trained a range of prototype ML models using the graphical interface for natural language processing (NLP) in Dataiku AutoML. In this way, a ‘best-fit’ model was constructed in less than two weeks instead of several months if the analysis had been performed manually. Backtesting was conducted; ca. 80% of e-mails were classified correctly.

The model deployment is planned for the first half of 2023. 
Approximately 650 work hours p.a. are expected to be saved using the automatic classification of e-mails.

 - Long description: Standardized data and model components within feature stores, which accelerate time-to-value by creating a common base for all teams to have consistent data naming, standards, and definitions.
Reusable plugins, which generalizes the code that the data team writes so it can be reused more easily, empowering team members to collaborate on projects regardless of skill level. The central data team at OHRA has also developed macros to standardize templates in accordance with its governance framework.
An operationalized governance framework to maintain trust and control over data and data products. Thanks to Dataiku governance features such as prescribed controls, checks, processes, and roles and responsibilities, data scientists are very clear on what is expected from them at every point in the development process.
Bias assessment applied to every use case that impacts customers (without additional time spent manually writing code or running queries). For example, the Model Fairness Report plugin in Dataiku is an integral part of OHRA’s data governance, making assessments reproducible and comparable between projects.
Easy deployment thanks to Dataiku APIs — the data team is now in control of deploying their own models without having to handover code or model artifacts to the IT team, saving time in discussions and testing. The IT team simply calls the API through a mutually agreed upon specification. If the model needs to be updated or changed later on, the IT team can simply keep calling the same API without much additional effort. The controls built into Dataiku, together with the embedded governance, provides the IT organization with trust that the data product they are integrating is built responsibly and reliably.

Prior to DSS the team would review only data set samples per asset class and derive/manipulate the data sets (excel files) manually from many different ERP systems

The DSS workflow was almost entirely created autonomously by the Business Analysts with minimal coding support by a DataScients. Outputs could easily be shared with domain experts to update asset’s useful life.

""DSS enabled us to analyze data across several ERP systems. The consumers of the output were very pleased with the analysis' accuracy and easy-to-trace steps.” - Group risk management

“Thanks to DSS it was really easy to discuss outputs (leveraging dashboards) with the experts who actually know the asset’s real useful life value” - Expert Accounting

 - Long description: Epsilon worked with Dataiku to build a real-time decision engine leveraging Dataiku for model development, workflow, and execution, automation node for job scheduling and monitoring, and API node for integrated services to the various applications for batch and real-time processing.

We integrated this solution into the brand's enterprise CRM and email marketing applications to deliver hyper-personalized email experiences. As each email campaign is generated from the marketing teams, the system calls our environment to return the next best actions for things like product recommendations, offers and promotions, best content, and best subject lines.

This sense and response environment ensures that no two emails are ever the same, and each one is uniquely personalized for every customer profile.

The machine learning test groups have outperformed the control groups by 47% for revenue per email open.

The machine learning test groups have driven a 20% lift in conversion rates over the control groups for all emails that were opened.

 - Long description: Context:
- User experience is everything. At Pon Automotive we strive for a seamless customer journey, from landing on our homepage to receiving your car keys and driving off into the sunset. Personalization of our website is the key starting point of this journey. 
- Personalization as a concept sounds intuitive and straightforward – the implementation was everything but. We needed an adaptive and contextual model that can predict what version of the website a user prefers seeing. User preferences change quickly. Today’s most popular model can be out of fashion tomorrow. Modeling all of this as a set of fixed business rules is an insurmountable task that rapidly grows in complexity with the number of car models and brands that are included.

Solution: 
- Instead, we developed an AI model, a deep neural network reinforcement learning model predicting a user’s preferences. The model runs as a containerized app in the cloud and interacts with the website. When a new visitor lands on the homepage and gives their consent for personalization, the AI framework is informed of the visitor’s interaction with the website. Upon reaching the homepage a second time, the website will be personalized based on the stored interactions. To keep the model informed of the latest changes in user preferences, we designed it using reinforcement learning principles. The AI framework adapts and learns about the latest changes in user preferences several times a day.
- The first step is building the data archives using automated scenarios. Every two hours the latest user interactions are retrieved from the data storage and processed using Dataiku recipes. Then comes the periodic training of the model together with hosting the new version as an API endpoint. Again automated scenarios are used to trigger the model training. The API endpoint, through which the website interacts with the model, is updated automatically after each model training phase.
- The migration to Dataiku and the automation functionality that comes with it decreases the time spent doing MLOps and, in turn, enables us to focus on implementing new features. One such feature is a functionality to boost certain types of personalization depending on the active marketing campaigns. For example, when a certain type of car is actively advertised using channels other than our website (e.g., television, social media) we can now choose to boost the personalization for certain types of users and display the campaigned model instead.

Results:
- For example, in terms of the click-through rate and completed car configurations we see an uplift of up to 100% compared to a standard and non-personalized website. And in the number of planned test drives, we are seeing an improvement of 70%!
- The self-learning nature of the AI model greatly simplifies the life of marketers. They no longer have to develop and maintain business rules to personalize the website. With the time gained they can focus on optimizing the marketing campaigns.

 - Long description: With a clear data infrastructure, Fanalists is able to support organizations in sports and entertainment. By making it as transparent and comprehensible as possible, everything clicks into place while also giving them the tools to play with their data.

Through this combination, our clients can get the most out of their data driven marketing strategy. It gives them the opportunity to focus entirely on their marketing, creating a great fan experience and exceptional personalization. That's where they excel. Fanalists helps them with this focus without needing an in-house data team or immense budgets. In short: data-driven marketing and decision-making within reach.

Let's make it specific. What sounds better: sending out a generic e-mail announcing a newly launched festival to the total newsletter base? Or sending out multiple segmented e-mails announcing a newly launched festival with their personal favorite as the sender? The latter is possible through the solution Fanalists offers, while keeping the impact and workload on the marketers as low as possible. And it results in higher open rates, better click rates, and, most importantly, higher conversion rates: an increase of more than 200% is more the rule than the exception.

 - Long description: Time saved: Approximately 175 hours per month of data engineering and data scientist time is being saved through centralizing the creation of the semantic layer and UVC While the introduction of ACT, has reduced the time spent producing consumer audiences by 98%.

The initial phase was to overhaul the data completely. Using a lean team of four data engineers and a data architect, we created a set of primary data pipelines in Dataiku to produce a semantic layer of our consumer data. This allowed us to efficiently ensure that huge amounts of data are cleansed, standardized, logically structured, and accurate. Using Dataiku’s scenarios functionalities, these pipelines are automated and scheduled. Resulting in no human intervention being required to ensure that the data is robust and available 24/7/365. We leveraged Dataiku’s ML capability to cleanse this data.

Our next focus was to join our disparate sets of consumer data to provide an enriched Unified View of Consumers (UVC). Our ad tech provides us with deterministic matches of consumer identifiers across different digital consumer touchpoints. And by using Dataiku, we could easily stitch all the consumer’s descriptive data to these matched identifiers to create a deeper understanding of each consumer. Dataiku enables a seamless transfer of this data into our enterprise-wide visualization tool.

Finally, utilizing Dataiku’s webapp capability, we built a simple, point-and-click interface (Audience Creation Tool, aka ACT) for non-technical users, to create audiences based on our UVC and a consumer’s unique set of behaviors, attributes, interests, and demographics. ACT transfers the audience to the relevant execution channel via a single click, powered by customized API connectors built in Dataiku.

 - Long description: 7 million dollars per week in increased sales. 98.5% Fill rate
31.5% sales lift in total(Consumables recorded 41% ; Fresh with the lowest at 27%)

This is the part that I think is the most important. I measure pre when they wanted to have it, when they have it, and then the post weeks. So like 10 weeks after we're actually seeing a sustained lift after the feature ends of another $4 million a week. So it's not even impacting just the baseline of when they wanted to feature this item. It increases the customer's demand more permanently on the items that they've chosen to feature. And we're holding that increase in sales long term.”

I really love the scheduling of Dataiku specifically because you can do SQL, you can do anything you want. You can put it in sequence there and have everything dependent on each other.So if any step of that fails, I'm able to halt the process importantly and not push a bad update. It is just a super powerful scheduling system that is incomparable to the other alternatives we had for sure”

Production data extraction and management is often time-consuming, impacting time-to-insights and batch quality. By utilizing Dataiku and machine learning for parameter analysis and what-if scenarios, the MSAT team reduced data management time from 3 days to 2, and machine learning analysis from 2 days to 1. This improvement grants greater autonomy to the shop floor, enabling scientists to self-serve and analyze data using a web app.

 - Current ecosystem: ['AWS', 'Tableau']

 - Long description: After switching to Dataiku, Bayard saw their full-time job application intake increase from 15 candidates (when using SAS) to over 200 candidates (when using Dataiku)! 

With over 20 automated campaigns, teams reduced their time spent on building campaigns by 42% and therefore, were able to spend more time on high-value ML projects. Automation enables them to produce more and spend more time on higher-value projects.   

Bayard’s data team has also seen a decrease in issues thanks to their ability to reuse work and an increase in reactivity and productivity thanks to alert messages. 

Before Dataiku, the data team did not do any ML so this opened a whole new realm to them. Dataiku’s visualizations features really helped the team increase awareness of the need of governance and data quality. This led to the development of a new governance process. 

Bayard decided it was time to modernize and meet market standards to remain competitive. What did this mean concretely? They needed to find a tool that was visual, multi-user, centralized, and easy to implement and adopt for technical teams. Indeed, Bayard’s team had certain profiles that knew only SQL, Python, or SAS. So they needed a tool that was not specialized in one of these, but could be used by all. After a market benchmark, the decision stood between open source and Dataiku — and Dataiku became the platform of choice.

 - Long description: Data-Driven CANDI as a whole is meant to provide considerable savings (~90%) in R&D costs compared to that of the current dimensioning tool.

The way Data-Driven CANDI has been architected is innovative in the sense that all the complexity of dimensioning is hidden from the user. This means that the dimensioning user is still able to perform its task trusting that the system will provide an accurate result. Moreover, this architecture and approach allows the possibility to expose the WebApp directly to our customers, so that they are enabled to own and plan their network CAPEX in terms of IMS and cloud resources.

 - Long description: ZS partnered with a life sciences and pharmaceutical organization to help orchestrate 100+ data science models projected to bring in annual incremental growth of USD$200M+.

ZS helped the client compare multiple platforms before Dataiku was chosen to be the platform for MLOps. 

The lean structure of the platform makes it easy to manage post 100% deployment. By 2023 we estimate a lean team of 3FTEs managing over 100 models, which today is managed by a team of 25+FTEs across the organization. The estimated efficiency gain of ~90% (Indirectly a significant impact – given we might end up replacing the current admin work).

Below are a few details on how we achieved such process efficiency:

1. Platform Automation: Earlier, the model was scored manually by running individual script(s) monotonous and repetitively. ZS saw this as an opportunity and stitched the entire Dataiku recipe flow into a one-click-based execution; it orchestrates the entire process at the click of a single button. We even introduced automated schedulers that trigger the model training using the latest data, validate model accuracy, execute the inferencing, and provide the notification to the stakeholders. Thus, providing the team with end-to-end visibility into the model lifecycle.

2. Model Runtime improvement: Earlier manual execution models involved multiple handoffs and inefficiencies because they were shared as ZIP files for deployment. By enabling One Click Execution of model prediction and One Click Deployment leveraging Azure DevOps, our team reduced model runtime from 48 hours to as little as six hours, thereby drastically reducing the model go-to-market time from six months to six weeks.

Value Generated:
This highly automated process has been estimated to save 56, 97, and 74 work hours in February, March, and April 2023, respectively. This frees up work hours for more complicated tasks that are less suited for automation. The process is scalable and puts Frende in a good position for growth, where we can handle larger volumes of emails in fewer work hours. We will also avoid risking that emails are forgotten or not handled within a reasonable amount of time, so the process is likely to have a positive impact on the response time and the total customer experience.

 - Long description: Prior to using Dataiku:
- The teams built a data lake to collect data from multiple sources, but actually using the data meant embarking on the painful process of writing new code (Python, Spark or SQL) every time.
- Every time they had a project, team members had to write a query, get the results, analyse those results with another tool, and write more code to reprocess and use the data. 
- Without an easy way to replicate past work, each project required them to start their process from scratch, no matter how similar two prospects or customers use cases were.

Thanks to Dataiku:
- This dramatic increase in efficiency allows the sales team to close more business.
- On top of efficiency gains, the team also has been able to do more prototyping and exploration, allowing them to deliver not only faster segmentation recommendations, but better and more granular ones. Dataiku has allowed everyone in the data department to focus on the strategic core of their job rather than on data preparation tasks.

 - Long description: Prior to implementing Dataiku, the HCP targeting process involved manual tasks and limitations in data handling. The team relied heavily on Excel and manual Python coding, which led to inefficiencies in data preparation and restructuring. The process required extensive time, up to 6 weeks, for data consolidation and completion of the targeting exercise.

The objective of implementing Dataiku was to automate and optimize the HCP targeting process, addressing challenges related to data preparation, visualization, and efficiency. The aim was to generate actionable insights, facilitate decision-making, and enhance overall targeting effectiveness.

 - Long description: Epsilon worked with Dataiku to build a real-time decision engine leveraging Dataiku for model development, workflow, and execution, automation node for job scheduling and monitoring, and API node for integrated services to the various applications for batch and real-time processing.

We integrated this solution into the brand's enterprise CRM and email marketing applications to deliver hyper-personalized email experiences. As each email campaign is generated from the marketing teams, the system calls our environment to return the next best actions for things like product recommendations, offers and promotions, best content, and best subject lines.

The machine learning test groups have outperformed the control groups by 47% for revenue per email open.
The machine learning test groups have driven a 20% lift in conversion rates over the control groups for all emails that were opened.
To date, the program has generated ~31k in net new revenue week over week.
Created a first of its kind, content optimization delivery system using deep learning and computer vision models in Dataiku.

 - Long description: Unilever had many teams sharing data insights, all of them obsessed with spreadsheets, and heavily reliant on external agencies.

Unilever used Dataiku to extract actionable insights in-house. This reduced their tiring resource-intensive reporting, and allowed the teams to shift focus from simply providing data via Excel, to delivering real insights & recommendations for action.  Saving £60 million over two years on agency spending.

This was a game-changer for them. It made them agile and efficient. Their newly created marketing delivery squad managed global governance with a local execution.  All in all this CPG leader ran 2,500 analyses in Dataiku instead of using external agencies, and saved over £60 million over two years on agency spending.  But it is not just about the money. They empowered their people, and created a better experience for their customers.

 - Current ecosystem: nan

 - Long description: Our objective was to build a continuous risk assessment tool that automates the monitoring of risk status and trends to provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of risk for an audit entity at any given time and automate the compilation of the audit plan.

Benefits are multi-faceted, and most impactful on two major areas:

1. Operational Efficiencies Department wide

i. Time savings from automating the continuous risk assessment process by streamlining administrative processes related to data sourcing, processing and risk calculations related to risk assessment.

ii. Reduction in manual processes and various end user computing tools such as excel files.

iii. Flexibility to diverge resources to platforms with elevated areas of risk and highest impact.

iv. Increase in consistency and repeatability of risk assessment process.

2. Quicker adjustments to the audit plan

i. Enterprise audit plan coverage can be aligned to areas of elevated risk.

ii. Visibility into emerging and changing risks on a continuous basis, which will help audit teams respond to changes in the risk environment by pivoting on the audit plan.


Due to the project scope, data is being sourced and processed from various source systems and teams across the Enterprise. This lends in itself key concerns around Data Governance that Dataiku has helped address such as:
- Data Lineage 
- Dataiku Metadata Integration with Collibra
- Data Quality
- Adherence to coding practices and version control

 - Long description: Our objective was to build a continuous risk assessment tool that automates the monitoring of risk status and trends to provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of risk for an audit entity at any given time and automate the compilation of the audit plan.

Benefits are multi-faceted, and most impactful on two major areas:

1. Operational Efficiencies Department wide

i. Time savings from automating the continuous risk assessment process by streamlining administrative processes related to data sourcing, processing and risk calculations related to risk assessment.

ii. Reduction in manual processes and various end user computing tools such as excel files.

iii. Flexibility to diverge resources to platforms with elevated areas of risk and highest impact.

iv. Increase in consistency and repeatability of risk assessment process.

2. Quicker adjustments to the audit plan

i. Enterprise audit plan coverage can be aligned to areas of elevated risk.

ii. Visibility into emerging and changing risks on a continuous basis, which will help audit teams respond to changes in the risk environment by pivoting on the audit plan.


Due to the project scope, data is being sourced and processed from various source systems and teams across the Enterprise. This lends in itself key concerns around Data Governance that Dataiku has helped address such as:
- Data Lineage 
- Dataiku Metadata Integration with Collibra
- Data Quality
- Adherence to coding practices and version control

 - Long description: Royal Bank of Canada - Building a All-in-One Control Testing Platform to Speed Up Audits

Leveraging the Control Test Framework process saves 20-25% of time for a given audit. Rather than incurring the overhead of testing controls during an audit, an automated process is run continuously. This gives the auditor insight into the strength of the control environment throughout the year, not simply at that point of time.

This new process creates greater certainty into the status of the control, allowing auditors for exploration of ideas.  Not only are significant time savings a benefit, but the quality of assurance is increased. As the 3rd line of defense, our core responsibility is providing assurance to RBC.

The result of the classification is a better than 94% positive prediction rate for silicon and protein SVPs across various sizes. 

In addition to potentially improved product quality and safety plus improved process development for more efficient manufacturing scale-up, the BioPerceptron platform is modular, which offers the potential of simplifying regulatory validation by only changing single components rather than an entire system. The Regeneron team used Dataiku as the front-end development tool to build and orchestrate workflows that utilized a host of AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock for large language models (LLMs).

 - Long description: Context: 
- U.S. Venture is regularly expanding to new markets, and part of that process involves creating an optimal logistics network, identifying potential customers, and pinpointing market risks and opportunities. 
- The Data and Analytics team has built up a series of data science services to enable U.S. Venture to make geographic expansion decisions based on modeled data that leverages many features about the market.

Before:
- When the team did modeling like this, it would take 60-100 hours per market

Solution:
- Create end-to-end, repeatable flows to reduce the effort and increase the collaboration and accuracy

Results:
- Time savings: now, using Dataiku, a new market can be analyzed in three hours, which represents a 95% to 97% time savings.
- Cost savings: it also represented hard cost savings by avoiding the cost of expensive point software solutions that address only a specific use case. Having Dataiku enables the Data and Analytics team to source, cleanse, model, and share repeatable data science solutions without needing to look to a third party for a software solution for each use case
- Upskilling: Data analysts are now able to step in to do a project rather than data scientists, which frees up the data scientists to work on new, more complex projects

 - Long description: Context:
- Not able to access to all the data needed
- Not reliable data quality
- Difficult to industrialize models because they require a lot of recurring & low value-added tasks
- Building ad-hoc tools for each use case - no reuse & no communication between the tools.
- Back-test strategies is difficult in this context

Challenge:
- Preserve my value, regardless of the temperature sensitivity of my customers

Solution:
- Building a model leveraging different sources (historical data (customer consumption data), weather data, seasonality, and open data from the market to optimise the forecasting)
- Clustering to segment clients based on thermosensitivity
- Optimize the trading strategies thanks to more reliable forecasts

Results:
- They did so successfully by reducing the mean average error from around 2% to 0.75%, which amounts to more than a 50% reduction

 - Long description: We first solved for data centralization into one place with Snowflake. Then, we leveraged Dataiku’s visual flows and DataOps to automate and schedule the PCA process. 

The C&L Analytics team generalized (parametrized) the processes so that our marketing stakeholders would only need to provide us with the campaign parameters (e.g. booking dates, travel dates, origin & destination, campaign project number, promo codes, registration codes, etc.) that are required to run a PCA process and started running the automated PCAs in batches, instead of manual bespoke ad hoc analysis. 

Once processes are run, all outputs are pushed to PowerBI in one single dashboard for consumption by our Marketing Stakeholders. 

Fulfilled and eliminated ~90% of Campaign PCA requests. Only deep dives on select campaigns remain. 

No more backlog - PCA available for all campaigns, as opposed to a subset of the most important ones. 

Opportunity cost saving: Data Scientists now have more time to invest on more added value projects!

The group selected by Next Best Product AI had an average account balance of $90,000 and opened 160 CDs with a total revenue of $7.4 million. The group selected by MSUFCU had an average account balance of $7,000 and opened a total of 53 CDs with a total revenue of $666,000.

MSU Federal Credit Union, a $7.3 billion asset credit union with over 340,000 members, was looking to provide targeted offers to members to increase investment in certificates of deposit in order to maintain liquidity during this time of rising rates.


Business Solution:
Once a group was identified, MSUFCU decided to run A/B testing in order to assess the effectiveness of the Next Best Product AI. The Trellance predictive model selected a targeted group of approximately 4,000 members to be included in the marketing campaign, Group A. The credit union used their normal selection process to randomly select a second group of 4,000 to be included in a separate marketing campaign, Group B.

Over a 30-day period, members in both groups received emails and a direct mailer promoting the certificate of deposit program. For those members included in either campaign, the marketing they received within MSUFCU’s mobile app was also focused on certificates of deposit. Content was the same for both groups and was sent out simultaneously.

 - Long description: Background
Customer review products and sentiment analysis - overall for the review and any aspect mentioned in review (style, quality, color, occasion, etc.).  Business looks at these scores at category or product class level and looks for trends.
--E.g. A particular subclass was having a high return rate and this was related specific to a particular product.

By being able to see the specific product that was impacting the review score for the subclass, we could then make changes just for that product.
Analysis is particularly helpful if there is an impact due to some product change, e.g. a vendor change and there is a quality impact (which is mentioned in product reviews).

Before Dataiku
--Sagemaker / Completely manual (putting files to S3 location, load cube manually, etc).
--Time to insight:  1.5-2 day.

With Dataiku
--Ported from Sagemaker - python notebook.
--Process is “almost 95% automated” - just place the input file and it’s auto-loaded.
--Time to insight: 4 hrs for the e2e process.   ⇒ 75% improvement
Porting was easy. Building the automation and plugins was the work afterwards.

 - Long description: The main challenge that the team seeks to address through the Logistics Touchbase use case is to empower decision-makers with a comprehensive understanding of business performance.

Starting with an initial set of 90 KPIs, the dashboard was simplified to a more manageable set of 20. The primary focus is the integration of forecasts, which allows for informed strategic decision-making.

By integrating forecasts and this new set of performance indicators (KPIs), it provides actionable insights that not only facilitate proactive detection of anomalies but also enable optimization of critical aspects of their logistics operations.

The emphasis on efficient forecasting and the reduction of KPIs offers valuable information that fosters sound decision-making as well as corrective actions. This is something that impacts the growth and competitiveness of MELI.

 - Long description: Detailresult is the service organization providing IT, finance, and HR services to the supermarket formulas of Dirk van den Broek and Dekamarkt.

Value Generated:
The metrics that were used to determine the success of the project were:

- The number of hours that products were out of stock (OOS).
- The amount of waste.
- The number of corrections that were made to the predictions by the stores as an indicator of the amount of time spent on the ordering process.

The project resulted in an almost 30% reduction in OOS hours, a 10% reduction in waste, and an average of 10-15 minutes of time saved each day in over 100 stores. With the amount of bread sold daily, the waste reduction is a big help in reaching the goals of the food retail industry to reduce their food waste significantly by 2030.

 - Long description: Time saved: Approximately 175 hours per month of data engineering and data scientist time is being saved through centralizing the creation of the semantic layer and UVC While the introduction of ACT, has reduced the time spent producing consumer audiences by 98%.

The initial phase was to overhaul the data completely. Using a lean team of four data engineers and a data architect, we created a set of primary data pipelines in Dataiku to produce a semantic layer of our consumer data. This allowed us to efficiently ensure that huge amounts of data are cleansed, standardized, logically structured, and accurate. Using Dataiku’s scenarios functionalities, these pipelines are automated and scheduled. Resulting in no human intervention being required to ensure that the data is robust and available 24/7/365. We leveraged Dataiku’s ML capability to cleanse this data.

Our next focus was to join our disparate sets of consumer data to provide an enriched Unified View of Consumers (UVC). Our ad tech provides us with deterministic matches of consumer identifiers across different digital consumer touchpoints. And by using Dataiku, we could easily stitch all the consumer’s descriptive data to these matched identifiers to create a deeper understanding of each consumer. Dataiku enables a seamless transfer of this data into our enterprise-wide visualization tool.

Finally, utilizing Dataiku’s webapp capability, we built a simple, point-and-click interface (Audience Creation Tool, aka ACT) for non-technical users, to create audiences based on our UVC and a consumer’s unique set of behaviors, attributes, interests, and demographics. ACT transfers the audience to the relevant execution channel via a single click, powered by customized API connectors built in Dataiku.

 - Long description: The transition to Dataiku catalyzed the creation and automation of over 50 reports and dashboards. Where once analysts toiled in isolation on their personal computers, leading to duplicated efforts and inconsistent findings, Dataiku offers a unified platform. This harmonization eliminates inconsistencies and fosters collaboration. Moreover, this centralized repository of insights has empowered decision-makers. With real-time metrics and a comprehensive overview of the observatory's operations, pinpointing areas for efficiency enhancement is now systematic and evidence-based.

What’s more, knowing about the delivery date helps to make the ROFO more reliable and to warn our partners and customers, allowing us to go from an 80% to an 85% compliance rate.
Thanks to Dataiku, we not only improved our data knowledge but also helped our colleagues to better understand the process and generally upgrade their technical skills. It’s helping to pave the way for data democratization across the organization, with many colleagues able to use Dataiku without formal training, and everyone able to understand what they’re doing despite coming from varying technical backgrounds.

When diving into the issue, we found out it was primarily a question of volume to get from 10 million to 400 million rows of data, not a question of underlying infrastructure — in fact, we already had robust compute warehousing, but almost no one was using it. We needed to find a way to leverage that existing ecosystem.

 - Long description: Day-to-day Change:
Implementing Dataiku as a modelling solution has demonstrated the ability to transform the process of developing market balances.

Previously, the forecasting process demanded substantial manual effort from analysts. A key goal of the program is to eliminate manual processes for preparing data. The balances models delivered allow us to retire 50+ Excel-based models and have facilitated a shift in our ways of working moving from a siloed individual desk approach to a collaborative workspace.

This new way of working results in a single data asset which enables a range of new views across products; the ability to roll back and govern releases; agreed sources of truth which can be shared; and greater accountability and trust in forecasts.

With centralized and trusted data foundations, the team can focus on value-generating analysis and speed of insight generation to our trading desks and executive management.

 - Long description: Value Generated:
Taking only into account the offers made available with classification models, there were offers available for only 7.9 million of our customers — those who already had products in the bank.

For those customers who only have the cash management service DaviPlata, no offer was available. Still, the output of our model allowed us to calculate the next best offer given the customer characteristics and credit history in other banks — an offer they could not have in any other way.

12.1 million customers now have the possibility of being offered a new product thanks to this model, which uses all available information to generate a product offer for this low-income segment of customers.

The main characteristic of the DaviPlata client is that they are part of the base of the social pyramid in Colombia, forming part of the low-income segment. This population has access to financial services and offers for the first time. Furthermore, the offers made are realistic, according to their actual ability to pay with the help of this tool.

Part of the popularity and traction gained by DaviPlata is explained by the actions of the Colombian government. From 2020 to 2022, they used the platform to send subsidies to the vulnerable population during and after the pandemic to help the most vulnerable with the difficulties derived from it. As the possibility for these people to access financial services was low, using this tool made financial offers available.

 - Long description: Head office of Heraeus, a German technology group with a focus on precious metals, wanted to support sales lead identification processes of differentiated operating companies. Leveraging Dataiku and GPT 4, the DS team of Heraeus managed to create an LLM engine to support this process, saving 70% of time thanks to automation of the sales lead identification process.

Each operating company of the Heraeus Group has its own, often informal, sales lead identification and qualification process. Heraeus wanted to use LLMs to support this process in a reliable manner.

Dataiku features like automation and the possibility to quickly deploy interfaces for end users with Dataiku applications and webapps enabled Heraeus to get this use case up and running very quickly — from initial discussion to implementation in five weeks — in order to focus on the use case and LLM without having to worry about the automation.

""Timing was fast and pivotal here. Dataiku made it possible in such a short timeframe and, from a technology capability point of view, we would not have been able to do it without them.""

 - Long description: Detailresult is the service organization providing IT, finance, and HR services to the supermarket formulas of Dirk van den Broek and Dekamarkt.

Value Generated:
The metrics that were used to determine the success of the project were:

- The number of hours that products were out of stock (OOS).
- The amount of waste.
- The number of corrections that were made to the predictions by the stores as an indicator of the amount of time spent on the ordering process.

The project resulted in an almost 30% reduction in OOS hours, a 10% reduction in waste, and an average of 10-15 minutes of time saved each day in over 100 stores. With the amount of bread sold daily, the waste reduction is a big help in reaching the goals of the food retail industry to reduce their food waste significantly by 2030.

 - Long description: Before Dataiku, the Whataburger team was using a simple bag-of-words approach to sentiment analysis. The approach involves representing text by counting the frequency of words in a document, creating a numerical vector that captures the word distribution, and using those vectors as input for machine learning models to classify sentiment. Importantly, the term bag-of-words implies disregarding the order of words, looking only at their frequency or presence. 

The team decided to partner with Dataiku to use LLMs to generate the same dataset that feeds into their existing dashboard. This way, they are actually able to capture the sentiment of the sentence, which is extremely notable because it’s done with no code required, making it accessible to a wider group than just technical experts. Another benefit of using the LLM approach is that Whataburger can easily add or remove review categories just by adjusting the prompt, without the need to change the pipeline or any code.

Whataburger has over 15 million reviews total, with over 10,000 new online reviews coming in each week, predominantly from social media. Therefore, the sheer amount of data they have to review and analyze is significant. The good news is that, with Dataiku, the solution is entirely visual, code free, and easy to manage — so the Whataburger team has more time to focus on using the reviews to improve the customer experience.

 - Long description: Context: 
- The Prudential Risks department carries out Solvency 2 reporting. These reports are critical for Aésio because they allow us to better adapt the equity required by the regulator to face the risks we incur in the course of our activity.

Before :
- Manual extractions + Excel (no automation)
- Teams were overloaded and did not have the bandwidth to perform all the desired simulations + human errors 
- Impossible to do ad hoc reporting because there is no clean and consistent data
- Consequences: unprocessed simulations imply maximum equity provisioning to limit all risks 

Solution: 
- Fully automated project (connection to data, generation of a pre-formatted Word file for the regulator)

Results:
- Time savings: from 1 week to 15 min per simulation
- Implementation of a robust and interpretable project: direct visualization of the impact of simulations
- At the organization level, the time saved allows for the best possible adjustment of the capital to be provisioned through the increased number of stress tests

 - Long description: In the past, the team had to employ a veritable cornucopia of tools to serve their clients and deliver planning and forecasting reports at a regular cadence. The amount of different tools, developed by various people over the years proved to be unwieldy when dealing with complex datasets. In addition, processing power (working on personal laptops was common), security, and data integrity were major hurdles.

Since Using Dataiku for More Than a Year as Their Centralized Tool of Reference, the Team at EyeOn has Been Able to:
- Shorten the time it takes to onboard new team members.
- Develop a modular system of building blocks and tools that they can use in different ways depending on the customer and the question they’re trying to answer.
- Sure up data governance policies and practices to ensure everyone is working in the same way with the same processes, including documentation and dataset tagging.
- Build different standard data project templates (for forecasting, inventory, etc.), which significantly shortens the time-to-delivery for customers.

 - Long description: Context:
- User experience is everything. At Pon Automotive we strive for a seamless customer journey, from landing on our homepage to receiving your car keys and driving off into the sunset. Personalization of our website is the key starting point of this journey. 
- Personalization as a concept sounds intuitive and straightforward – the implementation was everything but. We needed an adaptive and contextual model that can predict what version of the website a user prefers seeing. User preferences change quickly. Today’s most popular model can be out of fashion tomorrow. Modeling all of this as a set of fixed business rules is an insurmountable task that rapidly grows in complexity with the number of car models and brands that are included.

Solution: 
- Instead, we developed an AI model, a deep neural network reinforcement learning model predicting a user’s preferences. The model runs as a containerized app in the cloud and interacts with the website. When a new visitor lands on the homepage and gives their consent for personalization, the AI framework is informed of the visitor’s interaction with the website. Upon reaching the homepage a second time, the website will be personalized based on the stored interactions. To keep the model informed of the latest changes in user preferences, we designed it using reinforcement learning principles. The AI framework adapts and learns about the latest changes in user preferences several times a day.
- The first step is building the data archives using automated scenarios. Every two hours the latest user interactions are retrieved from the data storage and processed using Dataiku recipes. Then comes the periodic training of the model together with hosting the new version as an API endpoint. Again automated scenarios are used to trigger the model training. The API endpoint, through which the website interacts with the model, is updated automatically after each model training phase.
- The migration to Dataiku and the automation functionality that comes with it decreases the time spent doing MLOps and, in turn, enables us to focus on implementing new features. One such feature is a functionality to boost certain types of personalization depending on the active marketing campaigns. For example, when a certain type of car is actively advertised using channels other than our website (e.g., television, social media) we can now choose to boost the personalization for certain types of users and display the campaigned model instead.

Results:
- For example, in terms of the click-through rate and completed car configurations we see an uplift of up to 100% compared to a standard and non-personalized website. And in the number of planned test drives, we are seeing an improvement of 70%!
- The self-learning nature of the AI model greatly simplifies the life of marketers. They no longer have to develop and maintain business rules to personalize the website. With the time gained they can focus on optimizing the marketing campaigns.

Preparing for such court hearings requires the (expensive) court attorneys to search thousands of historical court decision documents, which is very time-consuming. They leveraged Dataiku to build a semantic search engine that helps the attorneys to quickly identify the relevant court cases.

Calculation: 5-10 attorney hours per court proceeding x 50 opposition cases/year x $400-500 per attorney hour.

 - Long description: With the model delivered, Service Analytics were able to prove their theory about the value that could be derived from changing shipment patterns across the company. Because Dataiku makes it easy to monitor, realign, and tweak existing processes as they run, Mohamed and the data team hope to improve their model based on tester feedback, and eventually to integrate it into Salesforce. Though the savings generated by the express shipping recommendation model will only fully materialize over time, the tool when globally implemented is estimated to reduce express shipment costs by 11-36%.

 - Long description: The Commercial team needs a comprehensive view of KPIs, such as price and availability, to compare Sanofi products with those of competitors. Data from internal and external sources must be checked for errors and consistency. Previously, this was done manually using SQL on a sample of 10 products from a dataset of over 2 million records. Now, the entire dataset is verified, increasing confidence in data quality.

The Data & AI Strategy Team utilized data preparation, SQL and visual recipes, automation and scenarios, and metrics and checks to ensure data quality throughout the automation process. The results are visualized through a Dataiku dashboard, providing insights into data quality and highlighting discrepancies between datasets. 

Thanks to this new process, the time spent on this activity has been reduced by 92% from 14 hours to 1 hour.

 - Current ecosystem: ['IBM Cloud', 'On Premise', 'Tableau']

 - Long description: Before:
- Used to run their process in SAS
- Needed to aggregate data from +15 sources across the bank, coming from treasury, Finance and Risk to fuel their stress testing engine
- Needed to handle the process end to end and to make sure they could quickly adjust to new regulatory requests (ie. COVID stress testing from BCE during pandemic), to changes in information system, …
- Also wanted to have something resilient from a key man risk standpoint: need to manage turn-over quickly on a highly complex and fragmented process
- Business needed to code, IT needed to be assured that code wasn’t going to lead to shadow IT. 
- Very high volume of data to be managed, and ever growing as stress testing becomes more demanding. Also needed to be able to quickly adjust to ad-hoc requests, different frequencies. 
- All this needed to be done in a fully governed and auditable environment

How:
- 17 data sources combined
- A number of different processes down to a core starting point
- Data wrangling only: no machine learning, but mix of receipes and code

Benefits:
- Code is done by team but no black box, maintained by IT
- Team’s activity has gradually scaled to become a center of excellence for the rest of the bank, providing starting points for a growing number of processes (regional level, to regulator, to Direction Générale, for internal monitoring, …)
- Process is managed end to end
- Savings through team scalability of the team, centralization of processes, …
- Improved governance while keeping agility and team empowerement

 - Long description: The Digital Leadership team required a centralized resource to track headcount and personnel costs amid a large international recruitment effort. The challenge involved reconciling data from different platforms, eliminating duplicates, and tracking budget changes against targets. The goal was to automate this previously manual spreadsheet-based process.

Utilizing Dataiku, the team employed Data Preparation and Management tools, including automation for data reception, visual recipes for data preparation and joining, and what-if analysis to run hiring scenarios and forecast budget impacts.

The result was a Power BI dashboard that allows the Digital Leadership team and hiring managers to strategically plan resources and hiring on a global scale. Productivity increased tenfold, with only one intern needed to maintain the workflow, freeing up ten data analysts for higher value-added tasks.

 - Long description: Orsted paid for 300 articles on focused news topics to allow the executive leadership team to make decision on where to invest, competitors products and supply chain issues to inform their strategic decision making. 300 articles equates to 5 hours reading time per exec (half a day of reading time, which equates to their salary *.5 as the cost of this process. If its a CFO paid 1 mil thats 500K a year) which was not feasible. Dataiku LLM mesh allowed them to experiment on LLM prompts to create summaries that condensed down these articles in to 5 summarise, ultimately automating the process and saving the time/money of the executive team.

As an end-to-end platform, it also features a dashboarding capability, so that we didn't have to introduce any other GUI tools. Our in-house personnel is empowered to analyze data, develop models, and communicate insights - which accelerates momentum across the organization to delve into other day-to-day improvements for further efficiency.

 - Long description: Before Dataiku was chosen as the platform for development, data scientists used multiple tools and technology stacks for ad hoc development, including Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, LiveRamp, and more. This distributed technology stack limited the scope of collaboration and model reusability across the teams.

Our team brought in Dataiku as a centralized platform for development and was able to portray its value from the very beginning. With the ease of development using a graphical UI-based implementation, data scientists could easily adapt and migrate to the platform. As a result of this, the utilization/productivity of the data science team went up by almost 40%.

Increased number of benefiting teams: From 1 to 3 (retail, corporate and private banking)

Increased Sales Revenue: multiplied by 2 without increasing team size
Increased frequency of leads: From twice a year to weekly

 - Long description: Epsilon worked with Dataiku to build a real-time decision engine leveraging Dataiku for model development, workflow, and execution, automation node for job scheduling and monitoring, and API node for integrated services to the various applications for batch and real-time processing.

We integrated this solution into the brand's enterprise CRM and email marketing applications to deliver hyper-personalized email experiences. As each email campaign is generated from the marketing teams, the system calls our environment to return the next best actions for things like product recommendations, offers and promotions, best content, and best subject lines.

The machine learning test groups have outperformed the control groups by 47% for revenue per email open.
The machine learning test groups have driven a 20% lift in conversion rates over the control groups for all emails that were opened.
To date, the program has generated ~31k in net new revenue week over week.
Created a first of its kind, content optimization delivery system using deep learning and computer vision models in Dataiku.

 - Long description: 1. Data scientists are more independent

The team moved from the in-house app developed by Python developers to Dataiku on Google Cloud Platform, which removed the barrier between research/development of algorithms and productization. This ultimately gives data scientists more independence and more control over the data pipelines, as well as more time to focus on the models that bring business value.

2. Time to production decreased

Dataiku enabled Effilab’s data team to reduce time-to-production by at least 3x. This change was driven by the nature of Dataiku as a robust solution, including allowing for algorithmic R&D to be facilitated by the model interface.

3. Smoother and more robust overall processes

In going from a mass of different tools and attempting to cobble them together in-house (data connections, Python recipes, Jupyter Notebooks, libraries integration for development, wiki, scheduled scenarios, monitoring) to Dataiku as an all-in-one solution, the overall processes and efficiency of the team are improved.

4. Data democratization

Later on, easy onboarding of data analysts that got access to data pipelines and databases, and were able to contribute more and more easily.

 - Long description: Approximately 30% of the time, structured, readily available datasets don’t exist for the types of analyses they want to do, so the team spends quite a bit of time digging for the data they need to find potentially relevant datasets that could ultimately produce interesting analysis.
When they do find data, it’s often incomplete. That means they have to put data through a set of business rules in order to fill out the missing data. For example, the first step might be to manually hunt for any missing data, and the second might be to create a standard estimation of the missing data.
When doing data analysis, the team at Startup Genome has to minimize bias and be able to consider the context of their data in order to truly draw meaning from it. For example, to determine the relevant relationship and whether there is a correlation between, say, engineer graduate data and startups in a region.

 - Long description: - Transforming more than 3000 domain experts into data science practitioners quickly was challenging in an instructor-led classroom format. We looked at a few EdTech platforms for self-learning options - they are expensive, with no guarantees of measurable success.

- After a few successful campaign phases, starting in November 2021, we have seen exponential adoption of data science learning, with 400+ certified data science practitioners and more than 2500 employees in various phases of their learning journey.
SLB recently crossed 4,000 Dataiku certifications and is on track to maintain this exponential learning adoption. We aim at least to double the numbers in the second half of 2023.

 - Long description: Prior to implementing Dataiku, the Data Science & Analytics team was experiencing two common pain points. Firstly, they had scarce and underutilized data experts. Secondly, their data processes (at the time) lacked operationalization and the ability to make a strong business impact. The team was looking for a platform that could both boost the efficiency of its coders and allow for cross-team collaboration with line-of-business users. The flexibility and collaborative functionality of Dataiku have allowed the company to explore solutions to common industry pain points in novel and creative ways. In two particularly important problem spaces — customer churn and delivery prediction — the team has quickly and decisively delivered improvements that have benefited the company.

 - Long description: Whataburger (Whatabrands group) was interested in using cutting-edge NLP techniques for analyzing customer reviews and displaying the results on a dashboard for their business and operations teams. Dataiku’s LLM features allowed to quickly and easily create a project that broke down each review into up to three topics and exact information for each topic. The dashboard displays which categories have the most positive and negative comments, how this has trended over time, which topics are occurring most frequently at each location, and the most common keywords. It is currently being used to identify problems - such as staff shortages, malfunctioning equipment, poor employee behavior - at all of their locations. This project highlighted 280k new topics over the past 6 months, vs 144k topics using the previous approach.

Whataburger has over 15 million reviews total, with over 10,000 new online reviews coming in each week, predominantly from social media. Therefore, the sheer amount of data they have to review and analyze is significant. The good news is that, with Dataiku, the solution is entirely visual, code free, and easy to manage — so the Whataburger team has more time to focus on using the reviews to improve the customer experience.

 - Long description: With DSS, all data sets from the relevant ERP systems were consolidated into one platform for analysis by domain experts

Prior to DSS the team would review only data set samples per asset class and derive/manipulate the data sets (excel files) manually from many different ERP systems

The DSS workflow was almost entirely created autonomously by the Business Analysts with minimal coding support by a DataScients. Outputs could easily be shared with domain experts to update asset’s useful life.

""DSS enabled us to analyze data across several ERP systems. The consumers of the output were very pleased with the analysis' accuracy and easy-to-trace steps.” - Group risk management

“Thanks to DSS it was really easy to discuss outputs (leveraging dashboards) with the experts who actually know the asset’s real useful life value” - Expert Accounting

""Without DSS, another tool would have to be found that is equally capable of providing no-coders/ controllers the possibility of doing the project or consulting firms would have to be employed - Thanks to DSS, the project could be done internally” - Senior DS

## Head
 - Solution name: Molecular Property Prediction

 - Use-case description (SFC): This business solution leverages public chemistry databases (Chembl, PubChem) to gather relevant data for studied molecules on your protein target of interest. It then utilizes Python libraries (RDKit, MOLFEAT) to extract key molecular features and generate fingerprints for machine-learning models. By analyzing past experiments and novel molecule structures, our solution predicts bioactivity. It also offers advanced analysis tools like molecular similarity and t-SNE embedding to visualize relationships between studied and novel molecules. This comprehensive approach empowers researchers to make informed decisions and accelerate drug discovery pipelines.

 - AT_Yixuan_comments: nan

 - Domain: Research & Development

 - Technical Dimension (SFC): Machine learning

 - Value Type: Save time

 - How to pitch it ?: This solution shows how Dataiku can be used to accelerate in-silico (aka with a computer instead of at a bench-side laboratory) drug discovery and design by using machine learning on features that represent the structure of small molecules that may target a specific biological function to prevent or treat a disease.  Novel drug candidates can then be scored by the model to predict bioactivity or you can extend it to other properties to speed discovery of a new drug candidate.  This can dramatically speed the time to the clinic and thus to market while also reducing the cost of a novel drug development by prioritizing efficient chemical experimentation at the bench.

## Head
 - Solution name: Store Segmentation

 - Use-case description (SFC): This Dataiku solution offers two approaches to store segmentation. First one is the Demographic driven clustering, which uses public census databases (i.e. Office for National Statistics, Census Bureau Data, Statistics, Canada, INSEE) to link to each store in the trade area in order to detect common, demographic patterns in the local population. Parameters such as trade area computations and number of clusters can be determined by the user. Second one is the Sales per Category segmentation, which allows the user to leverage transactional data for their product categories. The user can also define their preferred aggregation methods, along with their desired number of clusters and much more, in order to understand sales performance for each location. The segmentation approaches are designed to enable category teams better target trade area populations and improve category space.
